The marriage was childless.  Charles tried to divorce Richardis in order to legitimize a bastard son, but was not permitted to.  Eventually, he not only claimed that he had never known her physically but he also accused her of adultery with Bishop Liutward of Vercelli, his chancellor in 887, when he knew he was dying and was desperate to fix the succession.  Though she cleared herself of the charge through an ordeal of burning plowshares and a solemn declaration of virginity(1), she did accept the divorce and retire to a monastery in 887.  The monastery was Andlau which she had founded in 880 on her family lands; she also held the monastery of Zurzach, from Charles.  She died at Andlau between 894 and 896.   She was canonised, her feastday September 18, the date of her death.
