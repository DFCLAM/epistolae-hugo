<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>noble Saxon</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>late 11th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>Beatrice was a daughter of a noble Saxon family; her father was Elle of Reinhausen, her mother was from Katlenburg.&nbsp; They had four sons, Conrad, Heinrich, Hermann, and Udo, and three daughters, Beatrice, Mathilde, and Richenza.&nbsp; Udo, the addressee of Beatriceâ€™s letter, became bishop of Hildesheim.&nbsp; Beatrice was presumably widowed by the time of the letter to her brother.&nbsp; She had two grown sons, Hermann and Conrad, two daughters, Sophia, who is the object of unwanted attention perhaps from the king (Henry IV)1,&nbsp; Burtgard, a nun, and some younger children still at home.&nbsp; Beatrice had apparently married outside of Saxony, 2,&nbsp; but her family supported the anti-king Rudolf&nbsp; of Swabia; they were part of the Saxon-Gregorian party and were involved in Saxon revolts against Henry.&nbsp; That was probably the cause of the exile of her sons and the loss of her property.&nbsp; Since Rudolf died as a result of battle wounds in 1080, there was a possibility of reconciliation, though Henry was not noted for mercy to his opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
