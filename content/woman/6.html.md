Henry was a brother of Otto I, making Gerberga niece and first cousin of the emperors Otto I and Otto II.  Her father had been involved in various rebellions against Otto, and her brother, Henry the Wrangler continued to make trouble for his cousins.  But Gerberga apparently remained on good terms with them:  they petitioned the pope for her monastery, and she commissioned a history of Otto I from Hrotsvit.
