<h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Principia was an aristocratic Roman virgin who became Marcella's companion in a monastic setting, after Jerome and Paula and Eustochium left Rome.  She stayed with her until Marcella's death during the sack of Rome in 410.  Principia, who had supported Marcella in her battle against Origenist heretics according to Jerome (ep.127), was with her when she was attacked by the invaders and when she died.
