Cecilia was an illegitimate daughter of king Philip I of France and Bertrade of Montfort, wife of Fulk IV, count of Anjou and mother of Fulk, king of Jerusalem.&nbsp; Cecilia was married to Tancred, prince of Galilee and regent, later prince, of Antioch, in 1106.&nbsp; Before Tancred’s death, in 1112, he asked Pons of Tripoli to marry his young widow.&nbsp; There was some dispute about her dower with Roger of Salerno, prince of Antioch – she claimed Jabala, but accepted instead Chastel Rouge (Rugia) and Arzghan (Arcicanum), making Pons, according to Runciman (<i>History of the Crusades</i>, 2.188, citing Wm of Tyre), “one of the great barons of the Antiochene principality.”&nbsp; Cecilia met King Fulk, her half-brother, at Sidon in 1133, to tell him her husband had been ambushed by Turcomans and had fled to the castle of Montferrand.&nbsp; Fulk rescued him and&nbsp; soon thereafter, their son, Pons’s heir, Raymond II, married queen Melisende’s sister Hodierna, and their daughter Agnes married a son of Fulk’s constable at Antioch, Reynald Mazoir of Marqab.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
