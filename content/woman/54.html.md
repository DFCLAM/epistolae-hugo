<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>countess of Boulogne</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>1113</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Ida of Lorraine was the daughter of Godfrey II, Duke of Lorraine, said to be descended in the female line from Charlemagne, whose brother became pope Stephen IX.  She was the second wife of Count Eustace II of Boulogne, with whom she had three sons, Eustace III, Godfrey of Boulogne, and Baldwin.  Eustace inherited Boulogne; Godfrey became duke of Lorraine and one of the nine worthies; and Baldwin became first king of Jerusalem.  Both Godfrey and Baldwin were leaders in the first crusade, and Godfrey appears in the cross of the crusaders in Dante’s paradise, canto 18.  Ida’s brother, Godfrey, was married to Matilda of Tuscany. 
Ida was a supporter of Cluniac reform.  She corresponded with Hugh of Cluny, asking him to send Cluniac monks to the new monastery at Wast/Vaast, a letter now lost but known from an account of Hugh's positive response:  Interim "Ida comitissa" s. Hugoni, abbati, ut mitteret Cluniacensis ecclesiae quosdam fratres ad locum Wast appelatum institutione monastica inornandum supplicavit, atque multiplicatis et devotis precibus exoravit quatenus eam in filiam adoptionis redimeret.  Sanctus ... Hugo haec audiens ... desiderio atque petitione Dominae devote satisfecit.
