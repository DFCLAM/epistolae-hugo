She lives at Bec and seems to have been a patron of the monastery.  Anselm sends greetings to her and another women in a letter to the prior and brothers of Bec in 1092, calling them “our mothers”:  “salutate matres nostras, dominam Evam et dominam Basiliam,” ep.147.  In ep.68 to a monk, Anselm mentions Lord Hugh and Lady Basilia.
