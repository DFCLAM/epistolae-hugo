<h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>The nun appears as the recipient of a letter from Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury.  Both the editor and the translator of Anselm's letters suggest that she may be the daughter of Lord Richard and Lady Rohais of Tonbridge and Clare, to whom Anselm addressed another letter (ep.94), in which he thanks them for donations to the abbey of Bec.
