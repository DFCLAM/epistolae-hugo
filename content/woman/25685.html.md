Shorter oath by Dalmatius Bernardi, son of the woman Leggardis, to Raymond Berenguer and Douce for the <i>castros</i> of Madrona and Catserras and Montfalcho.</p><p>LFM 2.123-24, #615, dated 1117-31. Shorter oath of Berengarius Bernardi, son of the woman Legardis to RB and D for the <i style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">castros</i> of Miralies and Cheralt.</p><p>LFM 2.175, #665, 16 October, 1118.&nbsp; Shorter oath taken by Bernard Berengarii, son of Constance, to RB and D for the <i>castros</i> of Paracols and of Monte Albano.&nbsp; Unusual in having a specific date.</p><p>LFM 2.183-84, #673, 1117-31.&nbsp; Oath taken by Udalgarius, son of William Petri and Matellis, to RB and D for Fonolieto and St. Stephen, swearing to the same provisions as in #672.</p><p>LFM 2.185-86, #674, 1117-31.&nbsp; Oath of Udalgarius for St. Stephen; the period allowed for taking a new oath to RB’s successor is 30 days after RB’s death.</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">LFM 2.349, #880, dated 1113.&nbsp; Shorter oath taken by Peter Lombardi and Ripert of Sedena for the </span><i style="background-color: transparent;">castros</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> of Bredies and Belfort and Saleta.&nbsp; Sworn “by God and this holy Gospel.”</span></p><p></p>
