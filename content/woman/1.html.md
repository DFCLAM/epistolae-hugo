<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>queen of the Franks</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>1004</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>(See also Genealogical Table(s): <a href="https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/content/genealogy-charlemagne#n1">1</a>, <a href="https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/content/genealogy-henry#n1">2</a>.)<br>Adelaide was a member of the ruling family of Aquitaine, daughter of Guillaume III (Tête d’Étoupes), sister of Guillaume IV Fièrebrace. She married Hugh Capet, duke and later king of the Franks, and was involved enough in his government that he proposed her to negotiate for him with empress Theophanu, committing himself beforehand to whatever they determined (see his letter to Theophanu, MGH BDKz 2 ep.120, <em>Epistolae</em> 171.html).</p>
