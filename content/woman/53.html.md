<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>royal nun</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Gunhilda was a daughter of Harold II (son of Godwin), very briefly king of the English, and Ealdgyth of Mercia.  Gunhilda entered the royal monastery of Wilton after the Norman invasion, apparently in the expectation of becoming abbess.  She was abducted from Wilton by Alan Rufus, count of Brittany, just after William II of England had obstructed his plans to marry Edith (later queen Matilda), daughter of Malcolm of Scotland.(1)  Alan died shortly thereafter presumably before he could marry Gunhilda and his brother and heir Alan Niger determined to marry her in his place.  Searle argues that "marriage was a moment of inheritance quite as important as any admission into a fief," and that it was "one of the few ways of legitimately effecting a property transfer."  The outcome in this case is not known but from what Anselm says Gunhilda never married and she may eventually have returned to Wilton.
