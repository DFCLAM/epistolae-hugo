When she married the pagan king of Kent, Aethelbert, she brought a chaplain with her, bishop Liudhard.  Bede mentions the marriage and the presence of the bishop in his Ecclesiastical History, 1.25.  The king converted under their influence, and that of the mission of Augustine sent by pope Gregory in 596-97.  She was canonized as Saint Bertha for her help in the conversion of Kent.
