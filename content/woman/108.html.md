<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>5th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Salvina was an aristocrat, a daughter of Count Gildo,  governor of Africa, who had been appointed by Theodosius to replace the king he had defeated. Theodosius  took Gildo’s daughter as hostage and married her to the son of his wife’s sister, to ensure his loyalty, but Gildo revolted in 397 and was killed.   Salvina’s husband, Nebridius, was a nephew of Flacilla, first wife of Theodosius I and mother of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius.    Nebridius was apparently connected with the monastic circles at the imperial court.  After his death, Jerome wrote a letter of consolation to his widow, whom he did not know.1
