She assumed the crown in 1205, at age thirteen, after the death of her mother (and last stepfather).&nbsp; She married John of Brienne in 1208.&nbsp; He had been chosen as her husband and co-ruler by the French king Philip Augustus, at the request of envoys from the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem in 1208.&nbsp; She died in 1212, leaving a young daughter, Yolanda/Isabella, who inherited the crown and married the western emperor Frederick II in 1225.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
