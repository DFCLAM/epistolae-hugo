She was related to King Ethelbert of Kent, who wrote to Boniface on her recommendation, after she had met with him in Rome (probably 738--39), where she visited holy places with him, and asked him to offer counsel and prayers for the king as he had for her (ep.105).  She may be the Heaburg-Bugga whose mother Eangyth, herself an abbess, wrote in both their names to Boniface (see Eangyth, ep.14).(1)  The date of her death is mentioned by archbishop Bregowin of Canterbury in a letter to bishop Lul (ep.117) who says they celebrate it.
