All four daughters were married to kings, a phenomenon noted by Dante (Par. 6.133-35): Marguerite married Louis IX of France in 1234, Eleanor Henry III of England in 1236(1); Sancha in 1243 married Richard of Cornwall, who became king of the Romans and Emperor in 1257, and Beatrice (heir to her father's land) married Charles I of Anjou, brother of Louis IX, who became king of Sicily in 1246. Eleanor and Henry had five children: Edward I (born 1239), who succeeded his father in 1272, Margaret (b.1240) who married Alexander III of Scotland in 1251, Beatrice (b.1242) who married John II of Brittany, Edmund, earl of Lancaster (b.1245), and Katharine who lived less than four years (1253-57). <br>Eleanor supervised the education of her son Edward, and watched over him, staying with him for three weeks when he was sick in 1246 in the Cistercian abbey at Beaulieu against Cistercian rules(2). She was the designated keeper of castles for him if Henry died, and worked consistently for his interests, with the support of her Savoyard uncles, who played important roles in the English court in the 1240's and 1250's(3). Edward rebelled against his mother and her family for a time, but he came to respect her abilities and value her devotion during the struggle to retain royal power, and they remained on good terms for the rest of her life. There were times when Eleanor had to negotiate between her uncle Boniface, archbishop of Canterbury, and her husband, but he and Peter of Savoy were strong and key supporters of Eleanor and the monarchy. Howell describes Eleanor as a "highly significant political figure in the struggle between the king and the baronage," noting that she "encouraged the use of contingents of foreign knights to strengthen the royal power" in times of crisis, that she "gathered an army in the Low Countries, negotiated confidently with Louis IX of France and with the papacy, and by her energy and commitment helped to bring about the overthrow of Simon de Montfort and the rescue of her husband and eldest son from his control" (xviii). <br>Though Eleanor's political involvement led to some conflicts with Henry in the early 1250's, including her support of Simon de Montfort's actions in Gascony (Howell, chapter 3), he continued to rely on her abilities. When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry made a will leaving care of his heir and other children and all his territories to Eleanor, and appointed her regent, with the counsel (not co-regency) of his brother Richard: "Whereas the king has committed the governance of the realm of England and of the lands of Wales and Ireland to Queen Eleanor with the counsel of his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, until his return from Gascony...," Patent Rolls, 4.206, July 3, 1253. While the king was in Gascony, the entries in the Patent Rolls for 1253-54 are usually attested, that is officially issued, by either the queen or the earl of Cornwall, or both together. From August through October, they both "sign" in 5 of 6, but from November through the following May, she is the sole issuer in 40, he in 7. <br>In 1258, as her son was moving away from her and the Savoyard influence, there was an open split between Eleanor and the Lusignans who attempted to slander her, though the details of the slanders are not clear (Howell, chapter 6). But although she suffered from the anti-foreign feelings — she was once attacked by a mob from London Bridge when she was trying to go upriver (Howell, 196) — and the resentment against heavy taxation in the period of upheaval (1258-1263), Eleanor played a major role in restoring her husband and son to power (Howell, chapters 7 to 10). She was able to work with her enemies when it was in the interests of her husband and son, and she was highly effective at raising diplomatic and military support from her friends on the continent for their cause. The queen also kept royal authority alive in Gascony, by going there and asserting it herself, while Henry and Edward were under Simon de Montfort's control. The Gascons and the French king Louis IX accepted Eleanor's right to act for Henry even in defiance of writs that were issued in his name at Simon's instance. Her success at raising an army to invade England in support of her captive husband and son was admired even by her enemies. <br>But Eleanor's talents were financial as well as diplomatic.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had some control over her own resources and the appointments of her officials, and she managed to increase her holdings by buying debts and taking or leasing land given in surety for them and she held profitable wardships. She dealt with Jewish and Florentine financeers and her credit was good because she paid her debts(4). As a widow, Eleanor guarded her dowager rights, and kept her holdings even after she retired to the convent of Amesbury in 1286, a daughter-house of Fontevrault. At Amesbury, Eleanor joined two granddaughters, Edward's daughter Mary, and Beatrice's daughter Eleanor (who later became abbess of Fontevrault); they had both entered in 1285 at the queen's urging. She had a disagreement with Edward's wife, Eleanor of Castile, about Mary's enclosure, but they cooperated on behalf of another daughter, Eleanor, together convincing Edward in 1282 to keep his eldest daughter home an extra year after her marriage was contracted at 13 (Parsons, 37). Though Amesbury was Benedictine, Eleanor had always been sympathetic and generous to the Franciscans, and had looked to them for spiritual guidance, particularly Robert Grosseteste, Adam Marsh, and Thomas of Hales (Howell, chapter 4).&nbsp;<br>She was rumored to have written a 12,000 line romance, <em>Blandin de Cournouailles,</em> in her youth, but that legend has been discredited; she is known, however, to have purchased romances and she was the dedicatee of several books, the French life of Edward the Confessor perhaps by Matthew Paris and "Rossignos" by John of Howden (de Hoveden), the latter after her husband's death(5). Its subject matter suggests an interest in classical and Arthurian romance.<br>Eleanor also carried on an extensive correspondence. Howell reports that some 160 of her letters to others are extant, many unpublished (293), and her messenger lists indicate the wide range of her correspondents (Howell, 106) (6). There are references to letters she wrote, which may not be extant: Adam Marsh mentioned in one letter to W. of Nottingham, a provincial minister, that the queen had written him an affectionate and powerful letter, asking him to come to her when he could ("Scripsit mihi domina regina litteram affectuosam et efficacem, ut, cum opportunitas se offeret, praesentiam ipsius adire non omitterem"), which Adam says would be difficult for him. Meanwhile, the countess of Leicester, Henry's sister, has also asked him to come to her, and he is anxious about that as well (ep.172). In another letter to the same person, in which he speaks of his then troubled relations with the archbishop of Canterbury, the queen's uncle, Adam says that there were letters from the queen with petitions for W., and a letter she sent Adam, which he sends on to W. ("A domina regina quoque, ut ipse mihi postea dixit, obtinuit litteras cum propriis petitoriis ad vos, pro beneplaciti sui complemento ad vos destinatas, qui postquam veni Oxoniam misit mihi litteram, quam praesentibus inclusam vobis transmitto," ep.188). Some of her letters are mentioned in the Calendar of the Patent Rolls, e.g. 4.557, "Notification that the king has inspected a letter obligatory of Queen Eleanor and Peter de Sabaudia [Savoy] to the abbot and convent of Cyrencestre touching a loan"; 4.558, "the queen having accepted his said account, and made quittance thereof by letters patent, which the king has inspected"; 4.635, "Inspeximus and confirmation of a writing of the queen to the abbot and convent of Wardon"; 5.123, "The king of France has like letters patent of the queen [of England] sealed with the queen's seal."<br>Many of the documents in the Patent Rolls reflect Eleanor's involvement in financial matters, holding or selling wardships, making or buying loans, recommending or granting the pardon of debts (7): 3.244, 1241, Feb.12: Notification that John Lestrange to whom the king has committed the castles of Muntgumery, Shrewsbury and Bruges and the castles likewise of the county of Chester, during pleasure, has sworn on the Holy Gospels before the king and by letters patent bound himself that, in the event of the king's death, he will deliver the said castles to Eleanor, his queen, to the use of Edward his son and heir or another heir begotten or to be begotten by the king of the said queen; the king has granted to him that from the time when he has delivered the said castles to the queen, or her assigns, or if the king resume them, the said bond shall not be binding, but he and his heirs shall be quit therefore. 3.280 1242, April 8: The like [appointment during pleasure] of Bertram de Cryoyl to the custody of the castle of Dover, in this form, that he shall surrender it to no one but the king,and in the case of the king's death, to no one but Eleanor, the queen, to the use of the king's heirs and if the said Eleanor cannot come personally to receive it, then to no one but one of her uncles, not in the fealty of the king of France, to the use of the said heirs. <br>3.283 1242, April 26: Notification that Queen Eleanor, by licence of the king, has given to Bernard de Sabaudia [Savoy] the custody of Isabel the younger daughter and one of the heirs of Roger de Akeni, and of the land falling to her of the inheritance of her father, with her marriage, if the matrimony before contracted with her ought not to stand.

And for the faithful observance of this he has sworn on the holy gospels before the king. In like manner B. de Cryoyl has bound himself for the castles of Dover, Canterbury and Rochester. In like manner, Richard de Munfichet has bound himself for the castles of Hertford and Colecestre. 4.151 1252, Oct.3: Grant to the king's consort A. his queen of the wardship of the lands late of Margery de Riperiis, countess of Devon, during the minority of Baldwin son and heir of B. de Insula, sometime earl of Devon, for the issues thereof to be delivered into her wardrobe for her expenses; and mandates to the tenants of the lands to be intendant to brother William de Tarente as her bailiff in all that pertains to that wardship. <br>4.220 1253, Aug.3: Grant to Peter de Sabaudia [Savoy] that if he have an heir male of his wife, he may assign or bequeath the wardship of his lands and heir to whom he will.
