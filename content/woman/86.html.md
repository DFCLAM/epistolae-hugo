They were crowned in 1228, and they succeeded to the throne in 1230. They had two sons, Vladislaus, Margrave of Moravia, who died before his father, and Premysl Otakar II of Bohemia. Cunegund had three sisters, Beatrice, who married emperor Otto IV, Mary, wife of Henry II, Duke of Brabant, and Elisabeth, queen of Ferdinand III of Castile. Cunegund’s donations are evident not only in her own letters but in various others, e.g.: Pope Gregory IX mentions Cunegund’s constructing and endowing with her own possessions a monastery of nuns at Marienthal, in a letter to a Cistercian abbot, <em>Codex Diplomaticus et Epistolarius Regni Bohemiae</em>, ed. Gustavus Friederich (Prague: 1942), 3.1.143, ep.117, dated 1235. Wenceslas, at Cunegund’s request (ad pias preces domine et uxoris nostre gloriose regine Boemie Cunegundis) grants the place and foundation of a monastery of nuns following the Augustinian rule to sister Herberga, CDERB ep. 39, 3.2.121, dated 1244. The editors also mention a letter from Cunegund to a man in her service, Henry of Blisice, to whom she gives possessions in Blisice to be possessed by hereditary right in recognition of his service. The letter, dated 1244-48, is supposed to be published in v. 9 of the <em>Codex Diplomaticus et Epistolarius Regni Bohemiae,</em> ed. Gustavus Friederich, Jindrich Sebanek and Sasa Duskove (Prague: 1962), 4.539, ep. 382.</p>
