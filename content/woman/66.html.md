<h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Laeta, whose father was Albinus, a pagan, and a cousin of Jerome's good friend Marcella, was married to Toxotius, son of Paula, another close friend of Jerome's.  Toxotius who died c.403 had been brought up a pagan but converted to Christianity after his mother left Rome. They had one daughter, named Paula for her grandmother, who was vowed to God in the womb by her mother and went to live with her aunt Eustochium at the monastery adjacent to Jerome's in Bethlehem which her grandmother had built and which she would eventually run.
