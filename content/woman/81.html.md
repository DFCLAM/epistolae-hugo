<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>8th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>Cuneburg was apparently of royal stock and an abbess of an English house. Duckett says she may perhaps be the Cuenburga, abbess of Wimborne, sister of King Ine of Wessex, Eleanor S. Duckett, <em>Anglo-Saxon Saints and Scholars</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1947), 395, fn.96, and she may also be the Cuneburga involved in the group letter cited here, ep.55.</p>
