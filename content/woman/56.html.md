<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>sister of Anselm of Canterbury</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Richeza, Anselmâ€™s only sister (see ep.268), was married to Burgundius.  They vowed their eldest son, Anselm, to God and entered him in the monastery of Chiusa.  The younger Anselm joined his uncle in Italy in 1098 and was with him in Lyon.  The elder Anselm brought him to England in 1100 and he lived there until the uncle died; he later became abbot of St. Sabas in Rome, papal legate to England in 1115, and abbot of Bury St. Edmunds in 1121.
