<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>8th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>Nothing is known about this woman except that she calls herself a disciple, that Boniface was her dead brother's friend, and that she is learned. As Eleanor Duckett comments: "Her letter is short, and her misery is very great; she manages, however, to bring in four reminiscences of Vergil's <em>Aeneid</em>, two of various writings of Aldhelm of Malmesbury ..., two of a letter written by Jerome to the monk Rufinus, together with at least half a dozen quotations from the Bible," Eleanor S. Duckett, <em>Anglo-Saxon Saints and Scholars</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1947), 361. Eckenstein conjectures that her remote settlement might be Repton and that she might be the daughter of Ealdwulf, king of the east Angles, abbess of Repton, see Lina Eckenstein, <em>Woman under Monasticism</em> (New York: Russell and Russell, 1963, first pub.1896), 109, 125.</p>
