<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>Frankish princess, Queen of the Lombards</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>c.570</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>Chlodosind was the daughter of King Clothar and Ingund. Around 559 she married the&nbsp;Lombard king Alboin. This marriage was important politically, because it strengthened ties between&nbsp;the Frankish and Lombard kingdoms against the expansionist ambitions of the Byzantine Empire,&nbsp;the Lombards’ erstwhile ally. Paul the Deacon records that she had one child, Albsuinda, by Alboin.&nbsp;&nbsp;She died around 570, during the Lombard conquest of Italy (568-572).</p><p>The Lombards, and probably Alboin himself, were still largely pagan when Bishop Nicetius of&nbsp;Trier sent his letter to Chlodosind, a Nicene Christian. In it, Nicetius denounces the missionary&nbsp;activities of Arian Christians in Alboin’s court, and he provides Chlodosind with scriptural proofs to&nbsp;draw her husband to Nicene Christianity.*</p>
