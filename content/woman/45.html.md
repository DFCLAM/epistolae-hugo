Their letters span at least three decades, from c.716 to the mid 740's.  Eadburg was reputed to be zealous in the pursuit of knowledge and an effective abbess who secured several royal charters for her house.  She sent gifts of holy books and vestments to Boniface while he was doing missionary work in Germany.  He asked her to copy the epistles of Peter for him in gold letters — a display copy — and Lul sent her a style, so she was trained as a scribe, and her monastery presumably had a scriptorium.  Eadburg taught Lioba, a cousin of Boniface's, who later served with him in Germany; Lioba sent him verses she had learned to compose from Eadburg who, she says never ceases her study of holy scripture (ep.29).
