<h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>The Virgins of Haemon were one of the earliest religious communities of women in the West.  They were located in Emona, now Ljubljana, in the general area of Jerome's native Stridone and the city where he spent some years in his early manhood, Aquileia.  They apparently offered Jerome an important example of the religious life and of spiritual friendship.  When Jerome had to leave the region after strong attacks on him over unknown issues in the early 370's, he was cut off from relations with the virgins.  He would later write a letter asking their forgiveness and good will.(1)
