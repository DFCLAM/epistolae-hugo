We know her from a letter Jerome wrote in response to twelve questions about disparities in the gospels which she sent to him.  Jerome mentions the learned men in the preface to his answers, saying one taught rhetoric at Rome before he was born, the other “elevated all of Gaul with his talent in both prose and verse” when Jerome was young.
