<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>mid 4th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Theodora was the wife of a wealthy and highborn Spaniard, Lucinus.   They were both Christians who had vowed to live together as brother and sister and intended to travel to Bethlehem to see Jerome.  Lucinus had already sent his own copyists there to transcribe Jeromeâ€™s writings.  After he died, Jerome wrote a long letter of grief over his death, although he had never met him, and encouraged Theodora to remain true to her vow of chastity.
