<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>Countess of Vendôme</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>1119</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>A daughter of the viscount Hugh [III] of Châteaudun and Agnes, countess of Fréteval, Matilda was first married to Robert, viscount of Blois, who died early.&nbsp; Then she agreed to marry Geoffrey III, count of Vendôme.&nbsp; Relatives of both husbands raised objections based on consanguinity of the two men and bishop Ivo of Chartres called for a hearing on the subject.&nbsp; There seems to be no record of a hearing if one did occur.&nbsp; The marriage took place somewhere between 1102 and 1105 and the couple had two sons, John I, count of Vendôme, and Geoffrey, who became lord of Lavardin by marriage.&nbsp; Kimberly LoPrete, to whom I am endebted for all the information about Matilda in this biography, notes that the son’s marriage was “a relation closer in degree than his father’s to viscountess Matilda.”&nbsp; In any case, Matilda’s relation to her second husband was affinal, not consanguineous.&nbsp;</p><p>Matilda’s dower from Geoffrey included part of the Gâtines forest, that led to a dispute with the monks of La Trinité over hunting and pasturage rights, which was resolved before she died in 1119.&nbsp; After her death her husband gave more land to the monks to endow an anniversary for her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
