She was apparently from an aristocratic background, having been betrothed to a nephew of the duke of Burgundy as an infant.  Peter of Blois wrote to her applauding her choice of the religious life over a life of wealth and power.  In the PL, the letter is addressed to Anselma, but according to Michael Markowski, the best manuscripts give her name as Ascelina.1
