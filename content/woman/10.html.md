Edith (Eadgith) was herself a daughter of king Edward the Elder of England and granddaughter of king Alfred.  As the last surviving member of Liudolfâ€™s line (after the death of her brother Otto, duke of Swabia in 982), Matilda commissioned or requested a history of her distinguished English forebears from an English cousin, AEthelweard, who apparently adapted the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle into Latin for her and addresses her at the beginning of each book.(1)
