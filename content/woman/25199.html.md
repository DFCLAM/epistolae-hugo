William, lord of Montpellier), Aigeline (M. Hugh, count of Vaudemont), and Aremburga, who became a nun at Larrey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hugo and Matilda were devoted supporters of Bernard of Clairvaux, making many donations to houses of his order, Citeaux, Tart (for women), St. Benigne, Fontenay.&nbsp; Documents of donation include Matilda as a witness, who has given her approval, or as a co-donor; the two are also cited presiding over judgments of disputes at Dijon.&nbsp; In 1139-40, Matildaâ€™s name appeared in documents without Hugo, who may have been away on military expeditions (Petit, 2.39):&nbsp; in agreements between the religious of Reigny and of Tart with laymen, in donations of land and granting rights of usage.&nbsp; After the death of Hugo in 1142-43, Matilda continued to make and witness donations, sometimes with her sons, duke Odo II, Hugo, or Henry.&nbsp; She was dead by 1162.</p><p class="Bodytext21">Most of this information comes from Ernest Petit, <i>Histoire des Ducs de Bourgogne de la Race Capetienne</i> (Dijon, 1885, 1887) 2 v.</p><p class="Bodytext21">&nbsp;</p>
