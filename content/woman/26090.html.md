<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>Anglo-Saxon nun</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>Berhtgyth was the daughter of&nbsp; Cynehild, a materal aunt of Lull; both were probably participants in his mission to Germany.&nbsp; Berhtgyth was a teacher&nbsp; in Thuringia.&nbsp; She wrote the letters included here to her brother&nbsp;Balthard, who died in 798.&nbsp; He may have been abbot of Hersfeld Abbey, refounded by Lull.&nbsp; &nbsp;The letters are included in a collection of Lull's, probably as model letters.&nbsp; For more on the letters and the manuscripts, see&nbsp;<em>Berhtgyth's Letters to Balthard</em>, ed. and trans. by Kathryn Maude (Medieval Feminist Forum Texts and Translations, 2017), available at:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="background-color: transparent;">http://ir/uiowa/edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2105&amp;context=mff&nbsp; and&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;http://ir.uiowa.edu/mff/subsidia/.</p>
