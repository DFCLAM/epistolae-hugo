<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>Queen of the Franks</dd><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>823</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>869</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>(See also Genealogical Table(s): <a href="/content/genealogy-charlemagne#n96">1</a>.)<br>Ermentrude, queen of Charles the Bald, was the daughter of Odo, count of Orleans and his wife, Engeltrude.  Her uncle was Adalhard, seneschal of Louis the Pious, who arranged the marriage, through undue pressure, according to the historian, Nithard (MGH, SS2, 671-71).  She married Louis’s youngest son, Charles in 842, who hoped the marriage would secure the support of Adalhard against Charles’s brothers even though, according to the Annals of St. Bertin, she was Charles’s cousin.(1)  Ermentrud’s dowry included Feuquieres-en-Amienois and Chelles.  She was buried in St. Denis.
Though she bore eleven children, Charles wanted more (and different) heirs; three or more of the sons had died in infancy and he had differences with others.  Charles had Ermentrude consecrated queen, an unusual move, in 866, in the hopes of gaining God’s help in having more sons, and in gaining sons who would have stronger claims than the older sons no longer in favor.  Charles died in 877. 
Among their children were Judith of Flanders, who married AEthelwulf of Wessex, his son Aethelbald of Wessex, and Baldwin I, count of Flanders; Louis the Stammerer (died 879), Carloman, Lothar a monk and abbot of Saint-Germain, Rotrud and Ermentrud, both nuns, Hildegard and Gisela.
