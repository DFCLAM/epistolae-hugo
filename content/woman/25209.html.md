<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>Abbess of Arles</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>561</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">Caesaria was the second abbess of that name, succeeding the Caesaria for whom her brother, Caesarius of Arles, founded the monastery inside the city walls of Arles and wrote a rule.&nbsp; He revised the Rule for the second Caesaria in 534 and sent sermons at her request, with some diffidence, since&nbsp; he was not sure he had anything to offer someone who spent her time in diligent&nbsp; meditation on divine volumes ("sciam te divinis voluminibus assidua meditatione vacare").&nbsp; <br>When Queen Radegunde of Thuringia entered monastic life, she sought the Rule for the house she founded at Poitiers in 550.&nbsp; The second Caesaria sent the Rule along with a letter of encouragement.&nbsp; For the Rule, see <em>Sancti Caesarii, Regula Sanctarum Virginum aliaque opuscola,</em> ed. Germanus Morin (Bonn:&nbsp; Petrus Hanstein, 1933)&nbsp; and Maria McCarthy, <i>The Rule for Nuns of St. Caesarius of Arles</i> (Washington:&nbsp; Catholic University, 1960).</span></p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</span></p><p></p>
