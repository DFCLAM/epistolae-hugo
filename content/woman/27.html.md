When her husband had to return to Germany in 1118, he left her as regent in Italy with an army; though records of her regency are scant, they do include giving judgment in court proceedings (Chibnall, 33).  After the emperor’s death in 1125, she returned to England.  Her father obtained from the bishops and magnates present at his Christmas court, in January 1127, oaths of allegiance to Matilda if he died without male heir.  Henry married Matilda to Geoffrey of Anjou, ten years her junior, in 1127, apparently against her wishes.
This marriage produced a son in 1133, for whom his mother was able to assure the crown as Henry II, although she did not achieve it for herself.  She had, however, many supporters in England, including her uncle David, the king of Scotland, and her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry I. Her opponents supported her cousin Stephen, whose claim was through his mother, Adela of Blois.(2)  Matilda’s forces defeated and captured Stephen in 1141, but Matilda was never able to make good her claims, and was never called queen of England.  She was however briefly recognized by Stephen’s brother, the papal legate, and others as the “domina,” the ruling lady of England, according to William of Malmesbury, and she did exercize certain administrative powers in England.(3)  Matilda’s courage and tenacity were respected by her enemies as well as her supporters.(4)
Matilda removed to France in 1148 but continued to work for the succession of her son, Henry II.  She was called “empress” by him and others — even her second husband referred to her as the former wife of the Roman emperor.  After Henry’s accession, Matilda acted for him in Normandy, where she was recognized by Suger and Louis VII of France as its de facto ruler, and occasionally in England.  Her contacts with the papal court, and her experience of imperial administration made her a valuable advisor.  Matilda continued to have some influence over Henry, and to be asked to mediate between him and major opponents, like the archbishop of Canterbury and the king of France.(5)
