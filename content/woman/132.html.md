The letters that mention her indicate that she lived in Italy, in Campania.  Gregory speaks of her in ep.3.1 (592) to Peter, subdeacon of Campania.  Writing about punishing sedition against a representative of the church, Gregory reports that the slaves of the glorious Clementina (gloriosae Clementinae) are said to have been involved, even to have incited it and if it is so, they should be punished without consideration of her person because the servants of that noble lady (nobilis feminae) transgressed out of pride, and he should find out if she were in any way involved in the act.  Gregory also mentions her in 10.7, “our glorious daughter Clementina.”
