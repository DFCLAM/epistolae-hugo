She was married first to Eustace, count of Boulogne, son of king Stephen of England (grandson of Adela of Blois), who was associated with his father as king, giving Constance the title of queen, but he died before he could succeed to the throne.  A year after his death in 1153, she married Raymond V, count of Toulouse, younger than herself, with whom she had three sons and a daughter.  The marriage was annulled in 1166 for consanguinity, but the countess complained to her brother about mistreatment by her husband for two years before that.
