Adelgida/Adela &nbsp;was the wife of Amadeus I, count of Savoy and Belley (successor and son of Humbert I, “Whitehands”).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Adelgida is not otherwise identified, but she is likely to be of high birth; &nbsp;she is described in one donation as "illustrissima," &nbsp;most illustrious. &nbsp;She and Amadeus were married by 1030 and had two sons, Humbert and Aymon, and perhaps a daughter. *&nbsp;</p>
