<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>mid 4th century?</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>We know little about Castorina except that she was a maternal aunt of Jerome, who probably lived with Jerome’s family.   They were estranged by a fierce quarrel of unknown content and  Jerome seems to have tried several times to be reconciled with her.  Jerome’s relations with his parents were also cool during this period, when because of attacks on him, again not specified, he had to leave his native region.  Whether what led to his departure was also the cause of the estrangement from his aunt is not known.(1)
