<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>lady of Basochis</dd><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>12th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>We know Hadewich as the mother of Guido de Basochis/Bazoches. Guido was a writer and canon of the church of St. Stephen, Chalons-sur-Marne in the late 12th century. The family was noble, major vassals of the counts of Champagne, who held the office of “vidame” of Chalons-sur-Marne. Guido accompanied the expedition of Henry II of Champagne on the third crusade in 1190, about which he wrote in his world history. The history is mentioned in the 1203 <em>Chronicle of Alberic Troisfontaines</em>, along with his tract on geography, an apologia of his life, and his letters; Alberic also mentions Guido’s brother, Nicholas, abbot of Milo St. Medard at Soissons. We also know of a sister, Aelis of Castello Porcens, from a letter Guido wrote to her, so Hadewich presumably had at least three children and probably more since the two brothers mentioned went into the church. Guido died in 1203. Four of his letters are addressed to his mother, who asked him questions about the language describing the church, about the church and the town in which he serves, his home and his income. He also wrote a pathetic letter to her when he was sick, begging for her to come to him.*</p>
