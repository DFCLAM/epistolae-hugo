Guillermus . . . dono vobis ac diffinio et personam prefate Adalaidis et omne directum ... quas ... habeo...."). &nbsp;Adelaide did not, apparently fight the dissolution of her marriage, but neither did she renounce her claim to those lands, which the death of her brother Roger gave her, until 1070 (LFM #822).</p>
