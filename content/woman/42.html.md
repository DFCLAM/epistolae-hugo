<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>8th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Nothing is known about Cena, though her offer of help suggests that she may be an abbess, and the fact that she sees Boniface, albeit not often, may mean she is in a house on the continent not too far from his missionary work.
