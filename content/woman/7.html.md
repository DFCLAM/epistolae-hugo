<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Title social-status</dt><dd>nun of Gandersheim</dd><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>in 930's ?</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2>Very little is known about Hrotsvit beyond her writings and the fact that she lived and wrote in the abbey of Gandersheim in the tenth century.  She must have been noble to be a nun in the imperial abbey of Gandersheim and she was certainly educated.  She composed saints lives, plays modeled on Terence, and two epics, the life of Otto I and the history of the monastery of Gandersheim.  The works are preceded by explanatory or exculpatory and dedicatory letters, which are given here in the order in which they appear in the collected works, presumably the order in which they were written.
