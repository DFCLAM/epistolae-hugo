Pope Gregory wrote to Dynamius, ep.3.33, reporting that he has received the money from revenue in Gaul through Hilary, and sends him a cross with relics as a gift; in 4.37, Gregory says he is sending a letter to Dynamius about condemned doctrines; and in 6.6, he tells king Childebert of the Franks, that he is sending a priest to govern the patrimony for Dynamius, who is apparently unable to do it.
