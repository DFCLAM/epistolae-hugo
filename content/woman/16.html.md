After Odo died in 1162, Marie administered the duchy for their son Hugh III from 1162-65.

Marie and her son Hugh gave rights over the market of Dijon to maintain a lamp burning perpetually before the body of St. Stephen for the repose of Odo's soul, in late 1162 (Ernest Petit, <em>Histoire des Ducs de Bourgogne de la Race Capetienne</em> (Dijon, 1885, 1887), v.2. #390.</p>
