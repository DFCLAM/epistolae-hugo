We know her from a letter Peter addressed to her and to another sister, Sufficia, both widows.  Peter also refers to her in a letter he wrote to retired empress Agnes, in which he says: “And no one could ever persuade me to return to the house from which I had set forth, a swift traveller, except once, by I know not what destiny, I crossed on a stormy night that gate on a public road. The second time I was compelled to visit my oldest sister of holy life who had brought me up in the place of a mother and then lay very sick” (ep.149). This letter suggests both that his early life was not very happy and that Rodelinda was a rare good memory from that period.  Another letter Peter wrote to a "very dear sister" (dulcissimae sorori) in answer to her questions about the end of the world is thought to be to her, though she is not named in it.
