Emilie Amt (Oxford:&nbsp; Oxford University, 2014).&nbsp; I was made aware of Ediva by Emilie Amt’s earlier piece on her, “The Foundation Legend of Godstow Abbey:&nbsp; A Holy Woman’s Life in Anglo-Norman Verse,” in <i>Writing Medieval Women’s Lives</i>, ed. Charlotte N. Goldy and Amy Livingstone (New York:&nbsp; Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), 13-31.</p><div></div>
