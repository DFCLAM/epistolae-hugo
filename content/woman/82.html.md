<h2 class="mt-4">Overview</h2><dt>Date of Birth</dt><dd>11th century</dd><dt>Date of Death</dt><dd>12th century</dd><h2 class="mt-4">Biography</h2><p>(See also Genealogical Table(s): <a href="https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/content/genealogy-henry#n">2</a>, <a href="https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/content/genealogy-thibaut#n">2.3</a>, <a href="https://epistolae.ctl.columbia.edu/content/genealogy-henryfrance#n">2.4.1</a>.)<br>Constance, daughter of Philip, king of France, was married to Hugh, count of Troyes, half-brother of Stephen-Henry, count of Blois. There were apparently no children, since Hugh transferred his lands back to his nephew Thibaut II in 1125. Constance was involved in granting exemptions to a monastery and making donations of property that came to her from her father. Her generosity to the abbey of Molesme is also mentioned in a charter that records the concession by Adela, countess of Blois, and her sons to such a gift, after a visit that Constance and her husband made to Adela, c.1101, in which they spoke of their shared devotion to that church, see <em>Histoire des Ducs et des Comtes de Champagne, depuis le VIe s. jusqu'a la fin du XIe</em>, H. D'Arbois de Jubainville (Paris: Aug. Aubry, 1861, v.3), document 78, p.411-12. Constance is also a participant in a gift to the abbey with her husband, confirmed in a charter signed by Adela, c.1100-1101 (Histoire, doc.77, p.410-11).</p>
