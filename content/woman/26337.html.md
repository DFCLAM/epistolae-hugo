Agnes of Austria, the last of the Árpád queens, was born in 1281 and died in 1364.&nbsp; A member of the Habsburg family, she was the daughter of Albert, Duke of Austria and Styria, king of Germany and the Romans from 1303, and Elisabeth of Tirol; several of her siblings ruled parts of the German empire.&nbsp; She married Andrew III, king of Hungary in 1296; they had no children and Andrew died in 1301.&nbsp; Agnes brought a dowry of forty thousand silver marks to her marriage, and Andrew, speaking of the love her parents had showed him and wishing to show his in return, bestowed the county of Pozsony on her, for her to hold during his lifetime and as long as she lived. [1] &nbsp;Attila Zsoldos notes that there is no evidence she ever administered the county, but after Andrew’s death her father invaded Hungary, brought her back to Austria and presumably seized Pozsony, which remained in Austrian hands until 1323. [2]&nbsp; Agnes retired among the poor Clares in the monastery of Königsfelden which had been founded by her mother in a Swiss canton. She had a reputation for piety and was asked to mediate between Austria and Swiss regions. She died in&nbsp;Königsfelden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div><br><div><p></p></div></div>
