According to a report from a MS of Gregory’s letters, published as Appendix VIII in the CCSL edition, the images (icona) of Phocas and Leontia were sent to Rome, where they were acclaimed by everyone in the Lateran, clergy and senate, with the words “Exaudi Christe.  Focae Augusto et Leontiae Augustae vita.”  Then pope Gregory ordered the images to be placed in the oratory of St. Cesar inside the palace.
