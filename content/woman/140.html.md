She apparently stayed behind in Ravenna when her husband went to Rome, and he was anxious to have her join him.  He sent another John to bring her back and Gregory wrote both to her, encouraging her to come, and to Theodore, a municipal official (curator), to provide a military escort for them as far as Perugia (see ep. 9.117).
