She made overtures to Justinian, perhaps planning to take refuge with him, bringing her wealth and her kingdom, if need be.&nbsp; </span></p><p class="md-content-block"><span>Amalasuntha’s leanings towards Rome were antithetic to her Gothic nobles who plotted against her in 533; she had three of those suspected to be involved in a plot executed.&nbsp; When Athalaric died, she named her cousin Theodahad co-ruler hoping he would support her against the hostility of the anti-Roman Goths, though she had prosecuted him for unlawful seizure of Roman properties. &nbsp;He soon seized power and had her imprisoned on an island where she was murdered in 535, perhaps by the relatives of the nobles she had had executed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="md-content-block"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
