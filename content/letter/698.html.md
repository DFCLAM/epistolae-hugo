<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To his excellent and beloved E[leanor], by the grace of God queen of England, Alphonse, son of the king of France, count of Poitiers and Toulouse, greetings and the affection of sincere love.
The troubles inflicted on you do displease us, and we tell you that we have written our will more fully to that most excellent lady M[arguerite], queen of France, concerning the ships and galleys you wrote us about.  We are very grateful to you for wishing to know about our state, and want you to know that when this was written, we were well, God granting it, and we hope to learn the same about you again and again.
