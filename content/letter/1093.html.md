<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Innocent, Bishop, Servant of the Servants of God to the beloved son, nobleman Thomas count of Flanders, greeting and apostolic benediction.  The bright fame of your lineage and the devotedness of fervent sincerity of your ancestors and the integrity of faith which they have always had for the Roman church teaches us with manifest proof that you, being their son and true heir in these things seek to do those things with zeal of solicitude diligently through which you may please the prince of the apostles, and we, accordingly, should be bound to honor you, with the preference of favor and grace, as a special son of the church.  Therefore as your petition that was read in our presence contained, the daughter beloved in Christ, noblewoman J. countess of Flanders, your wife, with the voluntary and legitimate consenting agreement of her sister, daughter beloved in Christ noblewoman M. lady of Dampierre, if she will have survived to succeed her, has granted with prudent generosity, with oath taken, an annual income of six thousand pounds of Artesian currency to be collected in certain possessions and her revenues, to you for as long as you live, as is contained more fully in mutual letters prepared thenceforth, the sense of which we have inserted word for word in the present (letters), which is as follows:
To the most holy father and lord, by God’s grace the highest pontiff, J. countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, his humble daughter, kisses to [your]  blessed feet.  I wish to make known to your Sanctity that I, with the agreement of my dearest sister and my heir, as is contained more fully in her letters prepared concerning this, have given, granted, and allotted to Thomas count of Flanders and of Hainaut, lord and my husband, as is contained below, incomes or proceeds up to the value of six thousand pounds of Artesian currency to be collected after my death by Thomas himself every year for as long as he will have lived or by the particular messenger of Thomas himself, if the same Thomas will have survived me, and for this I have expressly obliged to the same Thomas myself and my land and particularly places named further below, promising by oath taken that never will I challenge the aforesaid gift, grant and allotment through me or through another, nor will I revoke these things, but I will observe and take care that (these things) are observed, renouncing every right and customary right through which I could attempt anything against the aforesaid gift, grant, and allotment.  I have ordered that the allotment of the said six thousand pounds occur in this way, so that from the revenues of Gastinois both old and new the same Thomas of Flanders should collect one thousand five[sic] hundred pounds of the aforesaid money, and for all the income of the villa of Dam. eight hundred pounds, for the rent and incomes of Trehout two hundred pounds, for the rent and incomes of the new port three hundred pounds, for the Cassel toll(1)  two hundred pounds, for the wood and revenues from the wood and the land from timber [niepa](2) one thousand pounds, for the dam with appurtenances seven hundred pounds, for the town granary  three hundred pounds, for the Furnes granary six hundred pounds, and for the town granary five hundred pounds.  Moreover in any place named above concerning all the incomes, rents, and revenues and in whatever name those things that belong to the place itself may be taxed, in no respect at all will a lord or lady be able nor should s/he collect in any case through him/herself or through another unless the said Thomas of Flanders or his messenger first will have totally received the sum of money allotted to him in the said places, and in the place in which the said Thomas will have received his total allotment which is owed to him annually the lord of the land must receive the remainder.  Moreover the receivers, whether they be hereditary or not hereditary, of the said revenues, rents, and incomes, and even the lessors or collectors, in whatever name they may be taxed, all will swear that, whatever mandate they will have received from the lord or from the lady of the land concerning this, they will pay or render nothing from the said revenues, incomes, and rents through themselves or through another to the lord of the land or to another before the same Thomas or his messenger will have received completely the money granted and allotted to him in all the above-said revenues, incomes, and rents.  Likewise the revenue, income, and rents must be reserved and received fully in the name of said Thomas each year until the said Thomas either through himself or his messenger will have received each year fully and completely the aforesaid sum of money allotted to him in the said places.  Also, the same Thomas or his messenger will collect from the receivers of the revenues, incomes, and rents and from the lessors or collectors themselves the sum of money allotted to him in the said places at three points of the year, in any point a third part of all the money granted and allotted to him as is stated above [sic].  The first point is at the feast of Saint Thomas the apostle, before Christmas.  The second point is in the middle of Lent, namely the Sunday on which “Rejoice O Jerusalem” is sung.  The third point is within the month after the feast of blessed John the Baptist, and all the above-said must be firmly observed.  The aforesaid lessors and receivers or collectors are bound to swear and through their oath to fulfill each and every thing fully and completely.  And if in any contingent case the aforesaid revenues, incomes, and rents were lacking or were not sufficient for the sum granted and allotted to the said Thomas or even were not paid to him, the lord of Flanders, as well as he who was occupying the aforesaid places, if by chance it were to happen that the aforesaid places were occupied by anyone, will be bound to supply the full said default within a month from the day of the reminder of the said Thomas or his messenger.  So that any of those ones may be bound fully to the same Thomas for the full satisfaction of this, also if within a month after the point of payment to be made the payment were not made to the said Thomas or his messenger, then the same Thomas or his messenger could complain regarding the default of payment not made to him in the allotted term.  Thence it is that I humbly beseech your sanctity, Holy Father, and I request on behalf of me and my heirs that you deign to confirm the aforesaid gift and allotment made to the said Thomas, and that for the observance of all the aforesaid you compel me and my heirs through judgments of excommunication for our persons and of interdict for our lands held and to be held, any contradiction notwithstanding, for as long as the same Thomas will have lived after my death.  Granted in the year of the Lord 1242 on the day of blessed Nicholas. 
To G., the most holy father and Lord, by God’s grace the highest pontiff, Margaret lady of Dampierre, his humble daughter, kisses to (your) blessed feet.  I desire to make known to your Sanctity that lady Joan countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, and my dearest sister, has given, granted, and allotted to the nobleman lord Thomas count of Flanders and of Hainaut, her husband, as included below, income and proceeds up to the value of six thousand pounds of Artesian currency to be collected after the death of the said countess by Thomas himself every year for as long as he will have lived or by the particular messenger of Thomas himself, if the same Thomas will have survived the countess herself, and for this the said countess has expressly obliged herself and her land,  specifically places named below, to the same Thomas, promising by oath taken that she will never challenge the aforesaid gift, grant, and allotment through herself or through another, nor will she revoke them, but she will observe and will take care that it be observed, renouncing every right and customary right through which she could attempt anything against the aforesaid gift, grant, and allotment. She has ordered that the allotment of the said six thousand pounds occur in this way, so that from the revenues of Gastinois both old and new the same Thomas of Flanders should collect one thousand five hundred pounds of the aforesaid money and for all the income of the villa of Dam. eight hundred pounds, for the rent and incomes of Thorouth two hundred pounds, for the rent and incomes of the new port three hundred pounds, for the Cassel toll(1) two hundred pounds, for the wood and revenues from the wood and the land from timber(2) one thousand pounds, for the dam with appurtenances seven hundred pounds, for the town granary three hundred pounds, for the Furnes(3) granary six hundred pounds, and for the town granary five hundred pounds. However in any place named above concerning all the incomes, rents, and revenues and in whatever name those things that belong to the place itself may be taxed, in no respect at all will a lord or lady be able nor should s/he collect in any case through him/herself or through another unless the said Thomas of Flanders or his messenger first will have totally received the sum of money allotted to him in the said place, and in the place in which the said Thomas will have received his total allotment which is owed to him annually the lord of the land must receive the remainder. Moreover, the receivers, whether they be hereditary or not hereditary, of the said revenues, rents, and incomes, and even the lessors or collectors, in whatever name they may be taxed, all will swear that, whatever mandate they will have received from the lord or from the lady of the land concerning this, they will pay or render nothing from the said revenues, incomes, and rents through themselves or through another, to the lord of the land or to another before the same Thomas or his messenger will have received completely the money granted and allotted to him in all the above-said revenues, incomes, and rents. Likewise the revenue, income, and rents must be protected and received fully in the name of said Thomas each year until the said Thomas either through himself or his messenger will have received each year fully and completely the aforesaid sum of money allotted to him in the aforesaid places. Also the same Thomas or his messenger will collect from the receivers of the revenues, incomes, and rents and from the lessors or collectors themselves the sum of money allotted to him in the said places at three points of the year, in any point a third part of all the money granted and allotted to him as is stated above [sic]. The first point is at the feast of blessed Thomas the apostle, before Christmas. The second point is in the middle of Lent, namely the Sunday on which “Rejoice O Jerusalem” is sung. The third point is within the month after the feast of blessed John the Baptist, and all the aforesaid must be firmly observed. The aforesaid lessors and receivers or collectors are bound to swear and through their oath to fulfill each and every thing fully and completely. And if in any contingent case the aforesaid revenues, incomes, and rents were lacking or were not sufficient for the sum granted and allotted to the said Thomas or even were not paid to him, the lord of Flanders, as well as he who was occupying the aforesaid places, if by chance it were to happen that the aforesaid places were occupied by anyone, will be bound to supply the full said default within a month from the day of the reminder of the said Thomas or his messenger. So that any of those ones may be bound fully to the same Thomas for the full satisfaction of this, also if within a month after the point of payment to be made the payment were not made to the said Thomas or his messenger, then the same Thomas or his messenger could complain regarding the default of payment not made to him in the allotted term. But I Margaret, lady of Dampierre, wish that the aforesaid allotment of six thousand pounds made to the said Thomas, as is included above, all land and property which he holds or in any way will hold, be quit and fully free from all debts incurred through the letters patent of the said count Thomas and the countess, or similarly through the letters patent of the countess, (debts) which might remain after the countess’ death, notwithstanding any customary right contrary to this, and I have praised and praise the aforesaid gift and allotment of the aforesaid six thousand pounds and I have considered and consider all the above-said as sure, as is contained more fully in the letters of the countess, and I have consented and consent to these same things on behalf of me and my successors or heirs and I have promised and promise in good faith to the above-said Thomas that neither through me nor through another will I attempt to challenge any of the aforesaid or anything, but I will firmly observe and in good faith will take care that it be observed. Also it should be known that I have given and conceded to the said Thomas whatever right I have or could have regarding any movable goods which he will have received and held and even those things which another will have held and received for him up to the time of the death of my said sister so that after the said time all the said movable goods will be his. Renouncing on behalf of me and my heirs every arrangement and right of privilege and customary right through which thing or things I or my heirs could attempt anything against the said Thomas or seek anything from the same reckoning of the aforesaid movable goods through which thing or things I or my heirs could attempt anything against the aforesaid allotment or anything of the aforesaid, and for the observance of all the aforesaid I have obliged and oblige to the same Thomas myself and my heirs and successors and all my property both held and to be held. I have promised and I promise to the same Thomas on behalf of me and my heirs or successors that I and my heirs or successors will make the lessors and receivers or collectors of the aforesaid revenues, incomes, and rents swear, namely those who have not sworn, on each and every thing which has been expressed above whenever we will have been requested by the said Thomas or his messenger. Moreover I promise on behalf of me and my heirs, to the same Thomas and his messenger, to defend and guarantee in good faith all the aforesaid, beseeching your Sanctity, Holy Father and requesting on behalf of me and my heirs that you deign to confirm the aforesaid gift and allotment made to the said Thomas and that for the observance of all the aforesaid you compel us through judgment of interdict on our land both held and to be held, notwithstanding any contradiction, for as long as the said Thomas will have lived if he will have survived the said countess. For the validation and perpetual security and memory of the aforesaid I have sealed the present letters with my own seal. Granted at Quesnoy in the year of the lord 1242, Wednesday after the feast of all saints. 

Therefore, judging it worthy that inclined to your requests we should carry them out, as a well-beloved son whom it pleases us [to hold] in the the embrace of benediction and favor, holding what was done in this case by those same noble ones as favorable and secure. We confirm it with apostolic authority and secure it with the patronage of the present document. Therefore may it be allowed to no person at all to violate this document of our confirmation or to contradict it with audacious attempt. However if anyone will have presumed to attempt this may he know that he will incur the indignation of omnipotent God and of His blessed apostles Peter and Paul.

<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The donation granted by countess Joan of Flanders to her husband, Thomas count of Savoy, which she submitted to the pope, with the agreement of her sister and heir, Margaret, was confirmed and approved by Innocent IV in a document sent to Thomas. Joan’s donation which is cited in full by the pope is presented here within the pope’s bull addressed to Thomas. as is Margaret’s letter of agreement (<em>Epistolae</em> 1094.html). Joan guaranteed Thomas six thousand pounds annually, from the revenues of her estates. The letters of the sisters, dated before the papacy of innocent IV, which began in June 1243, may have been addressed to Gregory IX, who died in August 1241, though the letters are dated 1242. The papacy was vacant, except for a few weeks in 1241when it was filled by Celestine IV. Thomas apparently applied to Innocent once he was in place to confirm the documents.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2><p>1 <em>Theloneum</em> is a tax on the transport and sale of goods. <br>2 The translation is based on the similarity of <em>niepa,</em> otherwise unnoted, to <em>nepta,</em> tinder. <br>3 In Margaret's letter, the word is <em>turnensem</em>, which must be a typographical error for <em>furnensem</em>. <br>4 The translation was provided by Ashleigh Imus.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Manuscript source:</h2>R.
