<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known that the church of Saint-Seine is completely quit and absolved from all the debts it ever contracted into their hands for themselves or any other up to this time to all our Jews of Burgundy, wherever we have Jews.  In witness of which I have had my seal appended to the present letters.  Enacted in this in this 1228th year of the Lord in the month of August.

In cujus rei testimonium presentibus litteris sigillum meum feci apponi. Actum est hoc anno Domini M°CC XXVIII0 mense Augusto.
