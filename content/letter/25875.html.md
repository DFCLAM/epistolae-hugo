<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all that our dearest faithful, Blanche, countess palatine of Troyes, at our request and urging, received Pons of Chaponnary, citizen of Lyons, in her [safe] conduct in good faith from us and our power until the next following feast of St. Mary Magdalene.&nbsp; If indeed any harm or injury should happen to said countess because of this, we would be held to make it all good to her, or she could claim [vadiare] it from us without crime.&nbsp; Enacted in the year of grace 1219, on the last day of May.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego Alaydis ducissa Burgundie.
