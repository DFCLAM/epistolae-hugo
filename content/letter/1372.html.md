<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to present and future that William, lord of Mont-Saint-Jean, commended and approved and made firm in our presence that donation which lord William, his father, made to the church of St. Stephen of Dijon for the tithe which he had at Thenissey in corn and in wine, and in good faith promised before us to bear to said church legitimate guarantee of said tithe against all false-accusers.  Enacted in this 1218th year of Grace, in the month of March.
