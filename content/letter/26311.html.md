<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present page, greetings in him who is the true salvation of all. &nbsp;The discipline of the holy house of God girded and protected by the sanction of holy canons directs that holy mother church be revered by all worshippers of God as the only hope of salvation through the merits of Christ, by which the discipline of the faith is revered and ordered, in which the indulgence of sins and the salutary redemption of the vices of human kind after the fall is deservedly sought and found, known to follow from public right, that consists mostly in priests and sacred uses as those prayers and their temples venerating God constantly,&nbsp; deputed by the faithful worshippers of Christ with a certain equal and fraternal protection by the happy prerogative of defense and tutelage, so that by witness of law that holy church of God may be freed from all profane arts, also all its patrimony assigned to the use of those serving God in it ought to be preserved since it should not be bound by goods – to whoever serves the altar and should live from the altar, so that it proceeds unbroken.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence it is that when the holy church of Veszprém, first of all the cathedral sees of the kingdom by which also by special prerogative and reverence the queens of the Hungarian kingdom as approved by charter of the church and custom of the kingdom are accustomed to be crowned with the reginal diadem from the time of its first foundation, now with its wealth destroyed, that should compel us and other queens more sincerely at this time to enrich and endow it since affliction should not be double to the afflicted, by the new kind, alas, of hateful misfortune, that never otherwise except [when] a barbarian attempted an attack, whom the delight of temporal things were accustomed to caress with their transitory content, which they prefer, not entering into eternal things&nbsp; which also with raging tyranny ought in no way to disturb the prime movers, the said venerable church by the attacks of the evil in our most unhappy sight from no preceding fault whatsoever (i.e., for no reason), the most disgraceful complaints of those doing this, the cause in all things, not only to things of holy usage gathered there, but also profane things kept there for spiritual protection, with bloodshed moreover of Christ, of those who ought never be touched, those innocent persons at and behind the altars to the number of&nbsp; sixty eight, at those altars which had been decorated most preciously for the feast of the birth of God, were laid as bare as on Good Friday, with the remaining canons and persons of said church, who by happy chance had fled death, with their bodies rendered naked as at birth, &nbsp;naked bodies drawn outside the church as by horses, as if redeemed from the Saracens by money as it appeared they were freed from iron chains and prisons.&nbsp; With the harms computed so many by men worthy of faith there, that scarcely the movable goods of the whole kingdom might restore them today.&nbsp; With the rest of the holy things thrown down at that time and trampled under the feet of the plunderers, but indeed what more pestilential and oppressive crime, also unheard of enormity, the most venerable body of Christ trampled and destroyed by the abominable feet of the plunderers, the sacred vestments thrown down from the altars by rapine, so that Christ the son of God suffered more abominably from this people than formerly on the wood of the cross through the Jews for the redemption from sin of the living world.&nbsp;</p><p>We and our unfortunates, who for our sins are known to have been present though unwilling, are not able to deny&nbsp; the biting worm of stinging conscience, what we ought to give back to Christ for so much and so great offence by the performance of treason, thrown down with perplexity in judgment and some beginning of satisfaction, so that even if not quantitatively proportional at least it may be alms to diminish such terrible, such detestable sin, [we grant] all our wine-growers from the valley of Kaal with their things, possessions and persons to the uses of the afflicted church bestowing by our gifts perennially as we gather our dower and dower patrimony, ratifying as well the charters of our most beloved son L[adislaus] by the grace of God illustrious king of Hungary, who also granted more widely his <i>udvarnoks</i> [royal serving people] fixed in that valley mingled with said people, as we we understand from his charters on this, and said more liberal grants of our dearest daughter-in-law.&nbsp; Moreover another possession of ours called Corus, situated beside the town of said church called Merene of the aforementioned overthrown church, giving our dowry in some consolation we ratify perpetually in as much as we can and are able, another charter of our son composed over this, then shown and revealed to us with all its boundaries, lands, hayfields, vineyards and woods.&nbsp; Which though we granted the estate to Dominic son of Peter as usufruct a long while ago, finally also in a similar way to master Benedict elect of Esztergom with our others -- &nbsp;with property not at all separated from the estates situated there by us, announcing them altogether empty and void of men, if there should be, which we do not believe, certifying charters by anyone injurious to said church by right of property, when said Dominic son of Peter together with his brother Michael and their confederates –&nbsp; from the most abominable deed of the faction against said church -- was also the master of our <i>tavarniks </i>[chamberlains]<i> </i>and lord of the court remaining with power by the bulls of our serenity in that time.&nbsp; Also said master B[enedict] if he showed a charter, it would not be valid, since he expressly consented to said gift when it was made and we also interceding on this for rights.&nbsp; In memory and perpetual stability of which thing we have granted the letters protected by the power of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the prudent man master Gregory our faithful chancellor in the 1276th year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth Dei gratia regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus presentem paginam inspecturis salutem in eo, qui vera salus omnium.
