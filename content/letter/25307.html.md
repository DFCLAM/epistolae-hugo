<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the lord the 995th year from the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ in the month of November, eighth indiction to the holy mother church in the bishopric of Vercelli where the body of St. Eusebius lies buried where the lord Peter venerable bishop is seen to be the canonic site of that bishop of Vercelli where archdeacon Rainfred and archpriest and provost Cunibert are ordained to serve God.&nbsp;&nbsp; I, in the name of God lady Adelaide, empress, widow of the lord emperor Otto of good memory, who profess from my birth to live by Salic law, as offerer and donator on the part of said canonry,&nbsp; for the mercy and remedy of my soul, or to whom I said the present will have come, whoever in holy and venerable places would confer something of their things according to the word of the author will receive a hundred fold in this world moreover what is better, will possess life eternally.&nbsp; Therefore I, indeed lady Adelaid empress give over to you provost to the jurisdiction and possession of the canonry,&nbsp; said canonry of St. Eusebius, that is one court with arable land to the house which is called Carisiana, with the town there and with the chapel outside built near that town in honor of St. Matthew together with all the things pertaining to that court and with the dry (sicide?) port with all its channels from the chapel of St. Columban up to the river Po together with its servants and handmaids freedmen and women pertaining to that court and the area of said court with its house and arable land in which is that town with its protections and&nbsp; surrounding ditch/moat is by just measure one acre (<i>iuge)</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; with other things outside that town pertaining to that court there are between the plots (sediminas) and the open/arable ground where there are vines or meadows a thousand acres, arable lands three thousand acres,&nbsp; with grasses (germis?) and woods &nbsp;or forests and marshes &nbsp;four thousand acres, and if any more should be found in my jurisdiction of things in this place Carixiana or surrounding it, pertaining to that court and town or chapel, let it remain and continue as the above measure and all in this present charter of gift and offering.&nbsp; As a whole, as with the cottages and town or chapel of the court with the courts, gardens, plots, enclosures, fields, meadows, pastures, forests, osier-beds,&nbsp; fisheries, marshes, together with the aforesaid port and markets and tolls and all things cultivated and uncultivated, divided and undivided, with servants and handmaids, freedmen and women, all, and from all as much as are seen to pertain to that court, as a whole, that is this court with house and arable land, with town and chapel and all things pertaining to it together with accesses and entries and&nbsp; with its higher and lower [parts], as well as the said servants and handmaids, freedmen and women pertaining to that court, wholly and from this day, I give, hand over, offer to you provost archdeacon Raifred and archpriest and provost Cunibert on the part of said canonry of St. Eusebius situated at Vercelli for the mercy and remedy of my soul&nbsp;

Moreover, I lady Adelaide empress by the small knife, knotted straw, glove and piece of earth and branch of tree,* before witnesses, had given over and invested and had myself driven out and guaranteed and absented, and I relinquished it to be held by said canonry.&nbsp;
