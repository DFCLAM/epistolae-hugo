<h2> Translated letter:</h2>In the year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ 1075, tenth kalends of August, thirteenth indiction.  To the monastery of holy Mary that was constructed in the village of Pinerolo in a place which is called St. Veramus where the lord Aginulf is seen to be ordained abbot, I, Adelaide, countess, daughter of late Manfred, marquis, who have professed to live under Salic law, offerer and donor, have spoken thus:  Whoever has conferred anything from his property on holy and venerable places will receive in this world a hundred-fold according to the word of Christ; moreover what is better is that he will possess eternal life.  Therefore, I, Adelaide, countess, as above, for reward and healing of my soul, give and offer from the present day to the said monastery of holy Mary that is, half of a dwelling together with all things belonging to that half, that lies in the village of Pinerolo and in its territory near the church of St. Martin, and the half was governed and worked by it ... by Sismond the priest and Manfred, freemen, and in addition half of a market that was built in the village of Pinerolo near the church of St. Donatus with toll and all right of return and devised tax to be rendered, and whatever of my right to that half of the abovesaid market seemed to belong to me, Adelaide, as noted above; moreover I give and offer for reward and healing of my soul, entirely from this day to the same monastery of holy Mary the abovesaid half of my right noted above to the dwelling together with access and entry and with its higher and lower things as read above, and I confirm the present charter of donation there. Moreover by the small knife, knotted straw, glove and piece of earth and branch of tree,(1) for the share of the aforesaid monastery thereby I make legitimate transfer and investiture and I thereby have driven myself out, guaranteed, and I have made myself absent from the share of that monastery and I relinquish (it) to be held by proprietary right, making (it) thereby from the present day a part of that monastery or of whomever that monastery will give (it), with proprietary right by name whatever they will without any contradiction or reclamation by me and my heirs and representatives of heirs.  But if, which I do not believe will occur, I, Adelaide, countess, God forbid, or any of my heirs or representatives of heirs or any person opposed will attempt at any time to go against this charter of donation or will seek to infringe it through any contrivance, then let us inflict on that party, against which we have thenceforth brought suit, great penalty, which is one-hundred ounces of pure gold, two-hundred pounds of silver, and we will renew what we cannot vindicate, but let this present charter of donation remain firm and stable and endure unshaken with stipulation supported, and I, Adelaide, countess, as above, together with my heirs and representatives of heirs, will defend from any man, entirely, the above-noted offering, as read above, for the party of that monastery or for whomever the party of that same monastery will give, which if we cannot defend or if we seek to withdraw anything for ourselves thereby from the party of that monastery, through any contrivance, then let us restore twofold the above-noted donation to the party of that monastery, as according to circumstance it will be improved or they will value by judgment in a similar places, and I have embossed the parchment with ink from the earth.  Enacted happily within the village of Pinerolo.
