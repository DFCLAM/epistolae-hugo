<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Maria, by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and past, who will look at the present page, greetings in the author of salvation.&nbsp; We wish to bring to the notice of all by the content of the presents, that we have ordered for our settlers gathered or who will gather at Veröce, the same condition of freedom which the settlers of Segesd obtained favorably from the grace of royal kindness, so only that they are held to pay each year as a tax forty marks in coins of the lord king with that service according to more and less as the situation of the time should offer, on the feast of St. Michael to our man appointed by us for this at the time.&nbsp; Moreover they should also give us yearly in the way of victuals six hundred breads, six pastured oxen, a hundred hens, sixty measures (<i>cubulos</i>) of wine, a hundred measures of grain, with four measures of palms (<i>palmarum</i>).&nbsp; <br> We indeed, designated land with certain boundaries on all sides,&nbsp; for said settlers so that as they settled and would settle they might be sustained more securely.&nbsp; The first boundary of which land begins on the south from the high road that goes from Vaska to Veröce, where there is a land boundary under an oak; thence it proceeds towards a stream which is called Malacka creek and crossing it goes to a certain thicket where there is a land boundary; here extending through land boundaries by a certain plain it goes to the road that leads to Veröce, and there beside that road is a land boundary and crossing directly it goes to a wood called Kabonak to a road which is next to the wood Rawn, and rcossing directly through that wood it goes to a certain tree which is called <i>gyrtian </i>in the vernacular, where there is a land boundary; and here to a certain road which goes towards Veröce, where there is a land boundary under a tree called <i>ihor</i>; and thence to a tree which is called <i>has</i>, thence to an apple tree on which is a boundary signed with a cross; and thence it goes to the stream which is called Scina creek, and here crossing next to a wood by land boundaries it goes to a road towards the west and there is a land boundary; thence it turns back towards the south and at the base of the mountain next to a road is the land boundary; here it ascends to that mountain and at the top of the mountain under a cherry tree is a boundary and it descends from the mountain towards the west and at the base of the mountain under a cherry tree is the land boundary; and from here it goes directly towards the Veröce river, to a certain mill, and at the higher part of that mill it goes to a pear tree, where there is a land boundary; and thence it rises to a mountain at whose summit is a land boundary; thence descending to a certain valley it ascends to a . . . . . where there is a boundary under a <i>has</i> tree; and from there it goes to the Pribuoy vineyard, then proceeds to twin trees, of which one is a <i>has</i> and the other a <i>bik</i>, where there is a land boundary; and from there it rises to a <i>berch</i> and through the <i>berch</i> by wooden boundaries it descends to a certain thicket, where there is a land boundary; and from here it turns back northwards to a road which goes from Veröce to the village of Dus and crossing that road it goes directly by pastures and plains with boundaries by signed trees to a <i>cheret</i>, where there is a boundary over the <i>yegune</i> tree, and from there it goes into Dumbro (Dobrovo?) through wooden boundaries to a certain road where there is a boundary under an oak, from here crossing that road it goes to another road which is called Kyriztvt, where there is a land boundary and a cross signed on a tree; and by that road it goes to Lipova and through the Lipova river it comes to a high road which leads to Varasd (Worost) and beside that road there is a land boundary under an oak; and by that Lipova it goes lower and falls into the river Burzoch; crossing this it goes to the Chodoycha whirlpool/dam (<i>gurgitem</i>) and by that Chodoycha it comes next to the Drava and proceeds lower and reaches the land of the church of Bobocha, where there is a boundary in a <i>yegna</i> tree signed with a cross; and from there separating from the Drava, it turns back eastward and by a certain path comes to the Donoch stream and proceeding from the Donoch falls into the river Pyechna, at the end of which river is a land boundary; and from there through a plain it comes to a road which leads to Belcsö and crossing a road directly goes to the Sylacoycha river where the boundary is under a pear tree; and through that river it goes lower and falls into the Veröce river and through it it goes lower and goes out of the water to a <i>gyrtan</i> tree under which is the boundary; from here it proceeds through a great wood by trees signed with the cross and come to a certain river named Kopynna and from that river turns back southward and goes lower to a certain road in the crossing of which on each side of the water are boundaries and it goes through a wood into a certain small place, turns back eastward where there is a land boundary; and from there it proceeds towards Ebres to the south, crosses by a road where there is a boundary under a thicket; and from here it goes next to the Ebres wood westward, where the boundary is in a <i>has</i> tree; and from there it descends southward to a certain road where there is a land boundary; from here through that road by land boundaries it proceeds westward and comes to a road which is called Kyristvt and from that road eastward into a certain small place, turns back southward where the boundary is under a pear tree; and from there it proceeds to Grabroch, with land boundaries and trees signed with a cross, and comes to a road which is next to Grabroch and crosses the Grabroch wood directly and beside that wood comes around to a high road which goes from Vaska to Veröce and by that high road turns back to the previous boundary and so ends.&nbsp; <br> So that the content of our arrangement may obtain the force of stability, we have granted the present letters fortified by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated on the Island of Rabbits* by the hand of our faithful chancellor master Ákos, treasurer of the church of Alba, in the thousand two hundred fortyeighth year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Maria dei gracia regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam posteris presentem paginam inspecturis salutem in salutis auctore.&nbsp;
