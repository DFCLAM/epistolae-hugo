<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all present and future who will have notice of these letters, greetings in the true savior.&nbsp; Since justice is a power granting his right to each faithful person, through those to whom the governments of the kingdom grant in their rights with justice demanding they be nurtured and defended.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by the content of the presents that Lothard son of Amadeus&nbsp; our servant coming into the presence of the lord king Stephen and us to complain, laid out that since the lord B[éla] formerly king, our dearest father-in-law and father, and M[aria] formerly queen, our dearest mother-in-law and mother, of pious memories, conferred on him in perpetuity certain lands namely Bös and Árpádsoka in the county<i>/ispánate</i> of Jauriens and pertaining to the reginal jurisdiction, he had transferred these lands because he had devoted loyalties and services to us in parts beyond the Danube at a time of strife and war between those dearest parents of ours on one side, on the other indeed between our lord king St[ephen] and their rising barons; they were taken away from him and bestowed on count/<i>ispán</i> Hedric son of Dionysius.&nbsp; Asking and seeking humbly from us that we deign to have said lands given back and restored to him.&nbsp; Finally with Lothard frequently entreating and asking, it pleased our lord king St[ephen] that we restore with full rights the mentioned lands through Job son of Macha our man and our lord’s under witness of our faithfuls of the chapter of Jauriens to whom we sent our letters about that, as long as there was no opposition from the summoned boundary-sharers and neighbors.&nbsp; Therefore having received letters from said chapter on the content of this matter, said lands as said before, with the boundary-sharers and neighbors summoned under the witness of said Job and without any official opposition coming from said count Hedric, were reassigned and restored to the named Lothard; wishing those lands [that had been] conferred by our dearest parents on Lothard within those boundaries and limits as were contained in the letters of the oftmentioned chapter to be held fixed by Lothard and his heirs and successors of his heirs, for the merits of his faithful services and merits shown, we have left and donated them to be possessed in perpetuity.&nbsp;</p><p>Of which lands the boundaries and limits are held as in the letters of the abovementioned chapter;&nbsp; they are defined in this manner.&nbsp; The said land Bös begins in the east beside the river called Huzý Wegues which was former palatine H’s, where one marker was erected, from there it comes directly to the water called Chakatorba. Which is said Lothard’s, here it turns to the Sithsara waters which is the said palatine’s, where there is a marker, from there it goes to a bridge set in that water.&nbsp; Hence it goes to a water called Baluan.&nbsp; Which is Syke’s of the Opour kin and his cousins where directly beside that water three markers are erected, from there it comes to the water called Peturagatue where it abuts the lands of Buken son of Buken and Abram son of Sebus and of <i>udvarnok</i>s of Chyk in the west:&nbsp; whence it twists back eastward and comes to the bridge of the <i>udvarnok</i>s and of said Buken and Abram&nbsp; called Raghahyda where there are two markers.&nbsp; Of which one on the west is a marker of the land of Buken, of Abram, and said <i>udvarnok</i>s, and on the east land of Lothard, from which it goes to the water called Elenag, which is of said Buken, Abram and the <i>udvarnok</i>s, and to another water called Nogeer between which are raised two markers.&nbsp; Hence it comes to the water called Talketu where there are two markers.&nbsp; Of which one on the west separates the lands of those B[uken] and Abram and the <i>udvarnok</i>s from the land of Lothard from those lands where the land of the <i>udvarnok</i>s ends it turns thence for a little to a certain place of a mill from which it goes out to the water Poley&nbsp; whose western part is the said B[uken] and Abram’s, on the east said Lothard’s where there are two markers, thence it comes to the water called Megeag.&nbsp; Which is said Buken and Abram’s where there are two markers&nbsp; from which it comes to the Cyleh water where there are two markers crossing which it comes again to the Megeag water where it abuts the lands of the <i>udvarnok</i>s of Baka beside which in a suitable space it comes turning by two markers to the water Luuth where it abuts the land Warkun.&nbsp; Which is of that Abram where there are two markers where the land Bös ends.&nbsp;</p><p>Said land Árpádsoka beginning beside the land Arkun comes in the east to the water Eurem which is said Abram and Lothard’s.&nbsp; From there it turns to the Aruksartuu water which on the western side is Arkun’s on the east Lothard’s where the land Arkun ends.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there it comes south to a certain great road where it abuts lands of those of Posoniens castle in the town Zaz.&nbsp; Which road namely recovers on the east the lands of those of the castle on the south indeed the land of that Lothard where there are two markers.&nbsp; From here it goes to the Kamary water. Which on the east is of those of the castle, on the south of Lothard from which it comes to the Okoltou water which is similarly divided. From there to the Barch water. Which is Lothard’s.&nbsp; From here to the ancient willow marker called Hatarfyuz where the Árpádsoka land ends.&nbsp; From here the Bös land begins again and comes to said water Chulch whose eastern half is of said people of the castle, the southern Lothard’s.&nbsp; Crossing which it comes to the Byty water where it abuts the land of ringers (<i>pulsatorum</i>), [the other] half indeed Lothard’s.&nbsp; Here it turns to the town of said Buken called Tuunyg.&nbsp; Here it comes to the <i>feldhyd</i> water.&nbsp; Which on the higher part is Lothard’s, on the lower rather of the peop[le of Tuunyg town, from there it reaches again the Huzywegues water where come together the lands of said palatine, Lothard, and the said people of Tuunyg.&nbsp; So that the gift of the mentioned lands made previously to Lothard and restored and conferred later by us, may have the force of stability, we have granted the present privilege letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal to oftnamed Lothard and through him to his heirs and successors of those heirs.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father our faithful Philip, by the grace of God bishop of the church of Vác, chancellor of our court.&nbsp; In the year of grace 1270th.&nbsp; Third nones of December.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elysabeth dei gracia Regina Hungarie Omnibus tam presentibus quam futuris harum litterarum noticiam habituris, Salutem in vero salutari.&nbsp; Cum iusticia sit uirtus ius suum vnicuique tribuens, quemlibet fidelem in suis iuribus per eos quibus Regni cedunt Regimina exigente iusticia expedit confoueri et defendi.&nbsp; Proinde ad vniuersorum noticiam tenore presencium volumus peruenire quod Lothardus filius Omodeý noster seruiens ad domini nostri Regis Stephani et nostram accedens presenciam exposuit conquerendo quod cum dominus B. quondam Rex karissimus Socer et pater noster, et M. quondam Regina karissima Socrus et mater nostra piarum Recordacionum quasdam terras Beus videlicet et Arpar vocatas in comitatu Jauryensi existentes et iurisdiccioni Reginali pertinentes sibi contulissent in perpetuum, hecdem terre pro eo quia idem fidelitates et seruicia nobis impensurus ad partes ultradanubiales se transtulerat, tempore contencionis et guerre inter eosdem karissimos parentes nostros ab vna parte, ab altera uero inter dominum nostrum Regem.
