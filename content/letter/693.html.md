<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To the queen and R. earl of Cornwall.  As they and all the magnates and prelates of England have sworn and promised lately at Westminster that the king would cause the Great Charter of England to be kept in all its articles, the king persisting in the same purpose wills and commands that they cause the same, upon the oath of the several sheriffs to be publicly cried in all counties and to be kept; provided that the said magnates and prelates cause it in like manner henceforth to be observed by their own subjects.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry left the government of England in the hands of Eleanor, with the counsel of his brother, Richard of Cornwall.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1)After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
