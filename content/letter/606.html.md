<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Grant to Reynold Alardi of Rye that this time he may take away his ship which he brought to London lade with victuals to the use of Humphrey de Boun, earl of Hereford, and take the same to the earl in Gascony; and mandate that this time he be not molested on account of the shipping which the council staying in England is preparing in aid of the expedition of Gascony; until Easter next.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
