<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Henry, by Godâ€™s grace bishop of Utrecht, to his beloved relative lady Adelaide, formerly wife of lord John of Avesnes, greeting with sincere love.
	Since all tithes of newly tilled land should belong to us by right, we command to you, in virtue of holy obedience, by advising firmly that you collect and cause [them] to be collected, reserving them for our use until we will have announced to you what we have shall have caused to be done with them.
	Dated at Utrecht in the year of the Lord 1264, on the morrow of blessed Servatius.(1)
