<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all that I by my free will have released to the Cistercian house and brothers whatever I was said to have or had of right in the town of Corcelles, which Eudes of good memory, duke of Burgundy, my lord, will have given in alms to said house and said brothers without our assent.  Moreover other gifts and whatever alms said duke will have made to them in his life, as is contained in Cistercian charters, I held in force and commended and approved after the death of that duke and confirmed with the protection of our seal.  Enacted in the 1219th year from the incarnation of the Lord, in the month of September.

Insuper alia dona et elemosinas quascumque eis fecerat predictus dux in vita sua, sicut in cartis Cistercii continetur, post mortem ipsius ducis, ego rata habui et laudavi et approbavi, et sigilli nostri munimine confirmavi.  Actum anno ab incarnatione Domini Mo CCo XIXo mense septembri.
