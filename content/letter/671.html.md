<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To the queen and R. earl of Cornwall, the king's brother.  Whereas the king has not yet had respect unto Henry de Wengham, king's clerk, according to his deserts, he grants that he be provided for in one or more ecclesiastical benefices, dignities or prebends in right of the crown or in right of the keeping of archbishoprics, bishoprics, abbeys or priories, to the amount of 200 marks yearly of rent; and they are to confer these upon the said Henry as they fall void, notwithstanding any mandate directed to them for the provision of another, and as the said Henry is going with the king to Gascony, the king has commanded Master W[illiam] de Kilkenny, in conjunction with the proctor of the said Henry in England to prosecute the said business into effect with the queen and earl.
The like is commanded to the queen in the same words.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry left the government of England in the hands of Eleanor, with the counsel of his brother, Richard of Cornwall.  In this instance, Henry gives them instructions about providing ecclesiastical benefices to one of his clerks.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
