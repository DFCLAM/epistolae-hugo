<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To her most beloved lord and father, Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury: Matilda,
queen of the English, sending incessant greetings with love and faithful service.
The consoling love of your holiness may not be unaware, dearly beloved father, that my soul will be seriously disturbed by your very long and wearisome absence.(1) Indeed, the sooner and the closer the date of your desired return is promised to me by many people,(2) the more it is desired by me, since I long to enjoy your presence and conversation. My soul, most reverend father, will therefore not be delighted by any perfect joy or brightened by any true affection until I am able to rejoice at seeing again your presence for which I long with all the strength of my soul. In the meantime, separated from you, I implore the mellifluous sweetness of your kindness to deign to console and gladden me by the charm of your correction and the charm of your letter.
May the almighty and holy Lord protect you everywhere and make me happy by your return into my presence. Amen.(3)
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Dilectissimo domino suo et patri ANSELMO, Cantuariensi archiepiscopo: MATHILDIS, Anglorum regina, salutem continuam cum dilectione et servitium fidele.
Non ignoret, carissime pater, vestrae sanctitatis consolatrix dilectio animam meam vestra tam longa, tam taediosa absentia graviter fore turbatam. Vestri etenim reditus optati terminus, quanto celerior et propinquior a pluribus mihi promittitur, tanto magis a me, vestra frui optante praesentia et locutione, desideratur. Nullo itaque, reverentissime domine, perfecto gaudio anima mea laetificabitur, nulla vera dilectione exhilarabitur, quo usque vestram, quam totis mentis meae viribus desidero, praesentiam revidere gaudenter valeam. Vestrae siquidem benignitatis mellifluam exoro dulcedinem, ut interim me absentem vestrae amoenitate correptionis et litterarum vestrarum dulcedine consolari et laetificare dignemini.
Omnipotens et pius dominus vos ubique conservet, et de reditu vestro me ad praesens laetificet. Amen.
