<h2> Translated letter:</h2>In the year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ 1065, fourteenth day of the month of March, third indiction.  To the bishopric of the holy church of Asti, where now lord Girelmus is seen to preside.  I, Adelaide, countess, daughter of the late Manfred, marquis, who have professed from my birth â€¦ [Salic] law, as offerer and donor from the present day to the church of the holy mother of God and ever virgin Mary, seat of the bishop of Asti, said to those present.  Whoever has conferred anything from his property on holy and venerable places will receive in this world a hundred-fold according to the word of Christ; moreover what is better is that he will possess eternal life.  Therefore I, Adelaide, as above, countess, give and offer for reward and healing of my soul, from the present day, that is castles and chapels, plots and all things with those rights that belong to me through charter of sale on the part of Magnus and his sons, both within the castle of St. Stephen with a chapel built in honor of the aforesaid St. Stephen and within the castle of Canale with a chapel likewise built there in honor of St. Sylvester and with all things belonging to the aforesaid castles and chapels and all things in the valley of Bladinasca and in the villa of St. Michael with chapel and all appurtenances and in Vetroni and in Vezano with chapel of St. George with newly tilled-land (?equi in nouelle) in the godoni (?) laurel valley in Carcegnano, in the flat valley of beeches (?ceredallo ceretto) in Cuni et in Predarolo with the castle and with all things belonging to the castles and chapels, which together with all above are three hundred acres in size and by my faith with rights to the things in those places read above, and if more is found by similar just measure, read through this charter of donation and for reward of my soul, for the aforesaid bishopric or whomever the aforesaid bishopric will give (it), for the above-noted power, by proprietary right, as was said, both castles, chapels, grounds, and other vineyards, meadows, pastures, forests, stables and fisheries and marshes, cultivated and uncultivated, divided and undivided together with boundaries, borders, entries and exits of waters and channels of waters adjacent and belonging to their things with every right, and all things from all things as said above entirely, moreover with all my rights to those things named above, as read above, together with their entries and accesses and with superior and inferior things of those things as the size is read above, entirely, and from this day to the same church of the holy mother of God virgin Mary, I give and offer, from the present day for reward of my soul, moreover by small knife, knotted straw, glove and piece of earth and branch of tree(1) and I thereby have driven myself out, guaranteed, and have made myself absent on the part of the church of holy Mary, thereby from the present day for the aforesaid bishopric or whomever the aforesaid bishopric will give with proprietary name whatever they will want without any contradiction or reclamation by me and my heirs and representatives of heirs.  But if, which I do not believe will occur, I, Adelaide, countess, God forbid, or any of my heirs or representatives of heirs or any person opposed will attempt at any time to go against this charter of donation or will seek to infringe it through any contrivance, then let us inflict on that party, against which we have thenceforth brought suit, great penalty, which is two hundred ounces of pure gold, four hundred pounds of silver, and we will renew what we cannot vindicate, but let this present charter of donation remain and endure firm for long duration, and this thing as read above, (will be) defended entirely from every man by me, Adelaide, countess, as above, together with my heirs and representatives of heirs for the aforesaid church of holy Mary or to whomever they will give (it).  If we cannot defend it for the aforesaid church, and we seek to withdraw anything through any contrivance, then that donation (will be) twofold for the aforesaid church as according to circumstance it will be improved or they will value in judgment in similar places, and I, Benito, notary of the holy palace, embossed the parchment with ink from the earth, asked to write and delivered the document, confirming which, it was strengthened by witnesses below, enacted happily within the houses next to the church in the villa which is called Almesso.  Sign by the hand of that Adelaide, countess, who requested that this charter of donation be made and to whom it was relinquished.
Sign by the hands of Vitelmus, and Bruno viscount, and Henry father and son and Alricus and Benzoni, witnesses.
Sign by the hands of Liudo and Amedeus, father and son, and Rodulfus, deputy, witnesses living under Salic law.
I, as above, Benito, notary of the holy palace, writer of this contract of donation, completed, delivered, and handed it over.(2)
