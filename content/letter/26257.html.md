<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will peruse the present page, greetings in the Saviour of all.&nbsp; Pious grants of vows adorned with gracious awards should be supported with stable firmness, so that the militant church of God through which kings rule, should be enhanced by the generous hands of princes and can deservedly be adorned with desired gifts on their part.&nbsp; Hence we wish to make manifest to the notice of all present and future by the content of these, that when after the general assembly of our whole kingdom in Föveny in the thousand two hundred eightyninth year of the Lord celebrated around the feast of St. John the Baptist, we at the advice of lord Ladislaus, illustrious king of Hungary, our dearest consort, and of the prelates and nobles of our kingdom, we went to the regions of Somogy and Tolna; traversing those regions for a long time, we revoked and had revoked all the reginal lands occupied by whatever people, our conditionaries making them connect in their conditions to service owed to us, the lands and villages of the religious ladies of the Island of the Blessed Virgin, called Kosuh, Belch, Ráksi, and Dada in the counties of Somogy and Tolna, which master Mojs of good memory, when he was dying conferred on those ladies for the remedy and salvation of his soul with our permission and good will and public and clear instruments of approval. &nbsp;At the suggestion of certain enemies of those ladies we harmed them, causing their official to be removed from them in a short space of time.&nbsp; Since then, however, those ladies through their legal proctors had their documents and deeds exhibited to us with study of most assiduous labor and when these were inspected we found the gift of said master Mojs made of those four lands and villages, called Kosuh, Belch, Ráksi, and Dada, to be just, fitting, beneficial and honorable, we gave up, gave back, and restored by our officials, who had been removed and dismissed from those villages, with full plenitude and integrity of their rights, and had them restored to the church of the Blessed Virgin at the Island at Buda and the religious ladies living in that church and serving God perpetually, to be possessed irrevocably, peacefully, and by perpetual right, the grant of those possessions made firm by master Mojs of good memory, having it agreeable and accepted, renouncing by the authority of the presents every reginal right, so that what might happen in the present or future, we in whatever way in the matter of said possessions, called Kosuh, Belch, Ráksi, and Dada, hope to be favoured not unworthily by actions temporally and spiritually in donations to the churches of God, especially by those leading a religious life.&nbsp; Therefore so that the content of this our donation and grant may have the force of pertual stability and may not in the course of time be withdrawn as invalid by anyone, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father lord Benedict, bishop of Veszprém, our faithful chancellor of our court, in the thousand twohundred ninetieth year of the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth Dei gratia regina Hungarie universis Christi fidelibus presentem paginam intuentibus salutem in omnium Salvatore.&nbsp;
