<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Henry, by the grace of God king of England, lord of Ireland and duke of Aquitaine, to his dearest sister Marguerite, by that same grace illustrious queen of France, greetings and ever increase of sincere love.
Since your dearest son, the illustrious king of Navarre, is known to have assigned certain lands in Champagne to the noble man our beloved John, count of Brittany, and his wife Blanche, which lands said count and Blanche granted to their firstborn son John and his wife Beatrice, our daughter, as your love well knows, and the business of the conjugal bond contracted between the foresaid, the firstborn of said count and our daughter, was begun laudably by your wisdom, we approach your serenity affectionately asking that you advance said business efficaciously, if it please you, diligently imposing your counsel on said king, that the assignment of said lands be done swiftly lest, by delay in said assignment to said John and our daughter, his consort, there be undeserved harm or damage, and so that said business brought by you to this point, may be happily completed.
