<h2> Translated letter:</h2>The king to all to whom the present letters come, greetings.
Know that we wish and have confirmed by our oath given bodily, to give our dearest mother, Isabel, queen and countess of Angoulême, all her dower which she had and ought to have in England, as was assigned to A[Eleanor] our grandmother, and as the charter of lord John the kind our father bequeathed.   We have also granted her by that same oath to make a reasonable exchange for the dower which she ought to have in Normandy, Anjou and Poitou, in the reasonable view of upright and legal men, who are selected for this on our part and hers, until we have delivered said dower to her and what might fall short in that exchange, as we are able to acquire/purchase the parts of that dower to our and her service.
In witness of which, we had these our letters patent made.  Witnessed by the venerable fathers, S. archbishop of Canterbury, bishops E. of London, P. of Winton, J. of Bath, H. of Lincoln, R. of Salisbury, R. of Chichester, and our chancellor, W. bishop of Carlisle, Thomas the elect of Norwich, H. de Burgh, our justiciar, R. count of Chester and Lincoln, G. count of Gloucester and Hertford, Philip of Albiniac, Ralph, son of Nicholas our seneschal, Hugh our steward.
Dated by hand of said bishop of Chichester our chancellor, at Westminster, 18th day of December, in the 11th year [of our reign].
[Cancelled.]  They were surrendered.
