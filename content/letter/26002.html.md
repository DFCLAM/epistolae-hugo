<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To her dearest son, T[hibaut] count of Blois, A . nun of Marcigny, affection of maternal love.</p><p>I am indeed mindful, dearest son that when I was in the world (secular habit) removed the canons of St. Calais from the tithe on the gift of alms of Francheville, which our partner/associate count Stephen your father and I gave to the monks of the greater monastery, who [the canons] now claim it.&nbsp; Over which your love should know that those canons agreed [gave up] in this complaint in our presence with said monks as before, so that that complaint would be put to sleep without objection perpetually from then on.&nbsp; Wherefore I beg you, most beloved son, that you free our alms which we gave freely to the monks to them, and let the church of the greater monastery be troubled no further by any controversy about this.&nbsp; Hail.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Karissimo filio suo T[etbaldo]blesensi comiti A. marciniacensis monacha materne dilectionis affectum.&nbsp; Memor sum quidem, fili karissime, quod cum adhuc in seculari habitu degerem canonicos sancti Karilelfi, de decima super dono elemosine de Franca uilla, quam socius noster comes Stephanus pater tuus et ego maioris monasterii monachis dedimus, conquestos fuisse.&nbsp; Super quo nouerit dilectio tua quod idem canonici hanc querelam in presentia nostra jam dictis monachis ita prius annuerant, [al. dimiserunt], ut eadem querimonia deinceps sine reclamatione perpetuo sopiretur.&nbsp; Quapropter [al.eapropter] te, dilectissime fili, exoro ut elemosinam nostram quam libere monachis dedimus, sic illis libere custodias, ne ulterius aliqua controuersia super hoc ecclesia maioris monasterii fatigetur.&nbsp; Vale.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The countess who has retired to Marcigny as a nun, writes to her son about a claim made by the canons of St. Calais to a tithe she and her husband had removed from them and granted to the monks at Francheville.&nbsp; She makes clear that the case had been heard and settled in her presence and she sends a similar letter to the bishop of Chartres (76.html).&nbsp; For the date and commentary, see LoPrete, Adela of Blois, App.1, 525-26, #138.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>Charles Métais, <i>Marmoutier cartulaire Blésois</i>, 138-39, #146.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1132-37
