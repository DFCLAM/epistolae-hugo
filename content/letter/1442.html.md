<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Be it known, etc., that there was a controversy between Ermengard of Narbonne viscountess and William of Durban and his sons, because Ermengard complained that William of Durban and his sons had, as she said, rebuilt the castle of Montseret which her father had destroyed as punishment, by force and against her will.  Which controversy as it was long carried out in Ermengard’s court, finally [came to] amicable settlement that Raymond son of William of Durban by the order of his father and brother would swear the castle of Montseret to his lady viscountess Ermengard and her children if she should have them; if indeed she did not have children, William of Durban would not be held by the tenor of said oath to her other heirs, [she] would not exact another oath on that castle nor accept it except according to the form by which Raymond son of William of Durban had sworn nor have another taken on the body of that castle by his tenants beyond a similar oath and thus viscountess Ermengard received them in her fealty.  – I William of Durban and I Bernard and I Raymond his son approve this determination in faith and without trickery with this charter to you viscountess Ermengard; and I viscountess Ermengard in faith and without trickery with this charter approve this determination to you William of Durban and your sons Bernard and Raymond and resign and absolve you of all other complaints which I had against you for that castle.  Enacted this year 1153 from the Incarnation of the Lord, in the presence of Peter bishop of  Frejus and B. abbot of Lagrasse and P. of Montelauro and R. of Castriis and William of Laredorte and D. of St. Nazaire and E. of Leucate, and William of Poitiers and G. of Capestang and B. Raymond of Campendud and Raymond of Ouveilhan and A. of Boltenac and R. of Bizano and Gerald of Breuil and many others.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Notum sit, &c. quod controversia erat inter Ermengardam Narbonensem vicecomitissam & Guillelmum de Durbanno & filios ejus, eo quod conquerebatur ipsa Ermengarda quod Guillelmus de Durbanno & filii ejus castellum de Monte-Sereno, quod pater ejus pro justicia sicut ipsa dicebat destruxerat, per vim & contra voluntatem ejus reaedificaverat. Quae controversia cum in curia ejusdem Ermengardis vicecomitissae diutius agitata esset, ad ultimum amicabili compositione, ut Raymundus filius Guillelmi de Durbanno mandato patris & fratris sui castellum de Monte-Sereno juret dominae suae Ermengardi vicecomitissae & infantibus ejus si quos habuerit; si vero infantes non habuerit, aliis haeredibus ejus praedicti tenore sacramenti non teneatur Guillelmus de Durbanno, ejusdem castelli aliud sacramentum non exigat nec accipiat nisi secundum eam formam qua juravit Raymundus filius Guillelmi de Durbanno nec in corpore ejusdem castelli ab ipsis partionariis aliquod acaptum faciat praeter simile sacramentum, & inde recepit eos Ermengardis vicecomitissa in fide sua. — Hanc diffinitionem ego Guillelmus de Durbanno & ego Bernardus & ego Raymundus filius ejus per fidem & sine inganno cum hac carta laudamus tibi Ermengardae vicecomitissae; & ego Ermengardis vicecomitissa per fidem & sine inganno cum hac carta hanc eandem diffinitionem laudo tibi Guillelmo de Durbanno & filiis tuis Bernardo & Raymundo, & desamparo & solvo vobis omnes alias querimonias quas faciebam vobis pro ipso castello. Actum est hoc anno ab Incarnatione Domini MCLIII, in praesentia Petri Forojuliensis episcopi & B. Crassensis abbatis & P. de Montelauro & R. de Castriis & G. de Redorta & D. de Sancto Nazario & E. de Leucata & G. de Pictavi & G. de Capitestagno & B. Raymundi de Campendud & R. de Oviliano & A. de Boltenaco & R. de Bizano & G. de Broglio & multi alii.




<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The controversy resolved here is over a castle that had been destroyed by Ermengard’s father when its owners turned it over to his enemy Bernard Ato of Trencavel who was making war against him. It later came into the hands of the Durban family who rebuilt it without Ermengard’s permission.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>Devic and Vaissette, <em>Histoire Generale de Languedoc</em> (Toulouse: Privat, 1875) 5.1152-53, #591.4,</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1153
