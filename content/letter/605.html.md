<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Apointment, during pleasure, of Arnold de Bosco, justice of the forest on this side of Trent, to keep the whole bailiwick which Robert de Muscegros had de baillio nostro in the forest of Savernak, in the same manner as the said Robert held it.
By the queen and earl.
The like of the said Arnold to the keeping of the king’s forest between the bridges of Stanford and Oxford, with all appurtenances except the keeping of the castle of Rokingham, in the same manner as Geoffrey de Langele held it.
By the queen and earl.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
