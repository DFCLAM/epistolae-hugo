<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To her dearest lord Louis, by the grace of God venerable king, Ida, countess of Nevers, [sends] greeting and much love.&nbsp; Your highness will know that my son William vowed when he was ill that he would&nbsp; take on no business until he came back from carrying out a pilgrimage to St. Mary of Le Puy-en-Velay.&nbsp; Truly at his departure he asked me to give his thanks to you, his lord, whom he wishes to love and honor in all things, on his part and mine over the word you sent him by messenger.&nbsp; Which I now do, stating that when he comes back he will not delay to come to you and will speak with you about that word and other business of his.&nbsp; Be well and send your will to me who am yours.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Domino suo carissimo Luovico, Dei gratia venerabili Regi, I. Comitissa Nivernensis, salutem et plurimam dilectionem.&nbsp; Noverit celsitudo vestra quia filius meus Willelmus in infirmitate sua vovit quia nullum assumeret negotium, donec, peregrinatione completa ad beatam Mariam de Podio, rediisset.&nbsp; Verum in discessu suo rogavit me, ut vobis domino suo, quem diligere vult et honorare, in omnibus gratias referrem de parte sua et mea super illo verbo quod ei per nuncium suum mandastis.&nbsp; Quod utique facio, significans quod, cum ipse redierit, venire ad vos non differret, de hoc ipso verbo et aliis negotiis suis vobis locuturus.&nbsp; Valete, et placitum vestrum mihi, quae vestra sum, mandate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The countess writes the king to explain why her son, who has been quite ill, has not yet come to see him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>HGF 16.68, Epistolarum Regis Ludovici VII. 216.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1163
