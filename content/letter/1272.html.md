<h2> Translated letter:</h2>On the day of the martyr, which is the fifth day in the month of October, in the presence of Ubald, bishop of Mantua, and Ubald, judge, and Azo, son of Ubald of Parma and Crispo of Mandria and the sons of Rozo of Pelavo and many others, countess Matilda gave to the monastery of St. Benedict located beside the Po, in which monastery William presided as abbot at that time, the palace from the castle Ariano with proprietary right, and conceded to it the church of St. Prosper located in the same castle with the tithe belonging to the same church, with its court, having both access and [the place] where the garden is cultivated.  She also granted it the church of St. Donino located in Mt. Villa and the church of St. Prosper and the church of St. Gregory of Antognano with all possessions belonging to those churches, except the canonical right of the church of Reggio, with Heribert, the bishop of Reggio favoring and particularly consenting.  The aforesaid abbot, fleeing the society of his monastery on account of the persecution of the tyrant Henry, was sustained by the aforesaid countess in the mountains.  With mercy directed toward the support of the brothers, she granted all these things that are contained in this charter, to the aforesaid monastery perpetually with consent, as was said, of the bishop of Reggio without any contradiction or reclamation by the same countess Matilda or her heirs.
	This was done in the one-thousand-ninety-second year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ, fifteenth indiction.
	Enacted at Carpineti, happily.
	Ugo of Roteglia, Nordino of Gaio, Ubald of Carpineti, who were present as witnesses.
	(S.N.)  I, Guido, notary of the sacred palace, was present and wrote this grant charter.1
