<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To all to whom these present letters should come, greetings.&nbsp; We make known that the noble man Erard of Brienne and the noble woman Philippa his wife in our presence established at Molesme in the year of the incarnation of the Lord 1222, in the month of April on the octave of Easter, by their own will, acknowledge that they had quit and remitted, and moreover they quit and remitted there to our beloved and faithful Blanche countess palatine of Troyes, and count Thibaut her son whatever they claimed in the county of Champagne and Brie as fully contained in the letters of said Erard and Philippa, his wife.&nbsp; Moreover that same Erard and Philippa sought from us and asked us assiduously that everything we had seen contained in the letters of either of them composed about said quittance, and whenever they are shown to us by said countess and count or at their command, we will testify and confirm by our patent letters,and we promise to the said countess and count to do this.&nbsp; Enacted in the year and month and day specified above at Molesme.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Alaidis ducissa Burgundie.
