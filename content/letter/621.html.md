<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Appointment of James Fresel, escheator, to take from the tenants of William de Ferrariis, sometime earl of Derby in the counties of Northampton and Berks, their fealty to the use of Edward, the king’s first-born son and heir, to whom the king granted the wardship of the said lands as part of his grant of 15,000 marks yearly of land; saving to the wife of the said earl her dower therein. The said James is also to assess upon them reasonable tallage.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
