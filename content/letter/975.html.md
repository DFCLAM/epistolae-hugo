<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[Again]
Applaud God with the voice, give pious wishes, sisters,
that so many joys reside with you.
You lovers retain this with me cut off outside:
what commonly pleases, is not at the same time permitted to be.
May she remain long through separate ages with us,
flourish to share with all goods.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>[Item aliud]
Plaudite voce deo, pia reddite vota, sorores,
quod sic vobiscum gaudia tanta sedent.
me foris excluso vos hanc retinetis amantes:
quod commune placet, non simul esse licet.
haec longaeva diu maneat per singula nobis
floreat et cunctis participanda bonis.
