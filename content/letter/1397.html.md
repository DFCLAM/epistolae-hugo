<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all who will look at the present letters that lord Guy of Villecomte, knight, with the approval and consent of Elisabeth, his wife, and Gullelme, his sister, sold and handed over to the church of Saint-Seine for seven hundred and forty Dijon pounds whatever he had of right and said that he had at Frenois, in men and in other things, at Cuffio and Margelle, and in the territory of those towns, in woods, fields, waters, as well as other things.  Said Guy and his heirs truly are held to guarantee all that is included in this sale as described above to that church without any distress, in good faith, perpetually.  I indeed at the urging of said Guido, his wife and sister, gave my letters sealed with my seal to said church as witness.  Enacted in the 1225th year of Grace, in the month of December.

Dicti vero Guido et heredes sui omnia comprehensa in venditione ista, sicut predictum est, tenentur eidem ecclesie sine vexatione aliqua, bona fide, perpetuo garantire. Ego vero ad instantiam jam dictorum Guidonis, uxoris et sororis sue, tradidi litteras meas jam dicte ecclesie in testimonium sigllo meo sigillatas. Actum anno Gratie MoCCo XXV mense decembri.
