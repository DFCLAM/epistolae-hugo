<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>E[lizabeth] by the grace of God queen of Hungary to her faithful in the chapter of the church of Alba, greetings and grace.&nbsp; Since count John, son of Zsidó asked us to give him the land of Ómerse in the county of Tolna, in which Karachinus from the people of our “condicionals” is said to have lived, but the truth of its quality and quantity is not known:&nbsp; we command firmly directing your loyalty to give your loyal man as witness before whom our man Master Luke, son of Bágyon, going to that land, may inquire and know the full truth about its quality and quantity, and as he establishes it for you, you will write back faithfully to us.&nbsp; Dated at Buda on the third day of the octave of the Purification of the Glorious Virgin.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>E.
