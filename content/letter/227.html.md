<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To lady Matilda, Ubald bishop of Mantova, joy and happiness.
54.  We write the happiness desired by your immense desire.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Dominae Matildae Ubaldus Mantuanus episcopus gaudium et laetitiam.
54.  Immenso desiderio vestro desideratam scribimus laetitiam.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>Ubaldo’s letters are apparently in response to a request from Matilda for accounts of Anselm’s miracles; they are included in the life she commissioned from Bardone.  There is nothing to indicate that they are separate letters except the heading between them, and a reference in the second to something he had recently written to her, but Bardone apparently saw two letters though virtually the only text he cites is the one describing the miracles which is not included here.
