<h2> Translated letter:</h2>In the year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ 1078, seventh kalends of November, first indiction.  To the monastery of the holy and chaste mother of God, virgin Mary, in the place which is called Pinerolo, constructed near the church of St. Veranus, where now lord Ardwin, by Godâ€™s providence, is known to preside as abbot.  I, Adelaide, countess and daughter of the late Manfred, marquis, of renowned memory, who have professed to live from my birth under Salic law, offerer and donor of the aforesaid monastery, said to those present: Whoever has conferred anything from his property on holy and venerable places will receive in this world a hundred-fold according to the word of Christ, and moreover what is better is that he will possess eternal life.  Therefore, I, Adelaide, countess, as above, for reward and healing of my soul and for the souls of all my relatives and neighbors and of the faithful deceased, give and offer from the present day to the aforesaid monastery of holy Mary my whole portion, which is half of that court in Pinerolo with half of a castle and its fortifications constructed there with churches, titles, chapels built within the territory of that court as they belong completely or in part to my portion and exist with my rights, and with other things, both my seigneurial houses and the appropriate offices, with other buildings with plots, vineyards with their grounds, arable lands, meadows, pastures, woods greater and lesser with their grounds, tolls to be exacted, and other guard services and conditions thereby by right and with other territories in the mountains and plains and all things that belong to that portion of mine of that court and (that) exist with my rights eternally, as was said, both cottages of the castle with churches, houses, buildings, vineyards with their grounds, plots, arable lands, meadows, pastures, forests, workshops, banks, rocks and marshes, mills, threshing floors, fulling-mills, mountains, plains and mountains, markets, complaints/indictments and tolls thereby to be exacted, things cultivated and uncultivated, divided and undivided together with borders, boundaries, accesses and uses of waters and channels of waters adjacent and belonging to them with every right according to places and names pertaining to that portion of mine entirely.  Moreover I give, cede, and confer, from the present day, forever, from this day to the same monastery of holy Mary that half of the aforesaid court at Pinerolo with all things belonging to that half of my right, said above, together with accesses and rights of entry and with its higher and lower things as read above and through the present charter of donation I confirm it to be held there.  Moreover by the small knife, knotted straw, glove and piece of earth and branch of tree(1) to the aforesaid monastery I thereby make legitimate transfer and investiture and I thereby have driven myself out, guaranteed and I have made myself absent and the ownership of that monastery I relinquish it to be held, thereby making (it) over from the present day to that monastery or to whomever that monastery will give (it), with proprietary name whatever they will without any contradiction or reclamation by me and my heirs and representatives of heirs.  But if, which I do not believe will occur, I, as above Adelaide, countess, God forbid, or any of my heirs or representatives of heirs or any person opposed will attempt at any time to go against this charter of donation or will seek to infringe it through any contrivance, then let us inflict on that party, against which we have thenceforth brought suit, great penalty, which is one-thousand ounces of pure gold, two-thousand pounds of silver, and we will renew what we cannot vindicate, but let this present charter of donation remain firm for long duration and endure unshaken with stipulation supported.  And I, as above, Adelaide, countess, together with my heirs and representatives of heirs, promise to defend from any man forever concerning the aforesaid things as read above, of the aforesaid monastery of holy Mary or whomever the monastery will give (it), which if we cannot defend or if we seek to withdraw through any contrivance anything thereby from the aforesaid monastery or whomever the same monastery will give (it), then let us restore those things in twofold to the aforesaid monastery, as according to circumstance they will be improved or they will value in judgment in a similar places, and I have embossed the parchment with ink from the earth.  given to Giselbertus, notary of the holy palace, asked him to write the document, confirming which, he offered it to be strengthened below.  Enacted happily in the aforesaid place, Pinerolo.
Sign by the hand of that Adelaide, countess, who requested that this charter of donation be made and to whom it was relinquished.  Lord Cunibertus, bishop of Turin and of those churches of St. Donatus and of holy Mary has confirmed and corroborated this charter in my hand and (that of) Adelaide, said countess, in good faith, and without any reward, for reverence of blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, under whose law the whole monastery of Pinerolo stands, he praised, donated, and offered and conceded forever without any condition the aforesaid churches on the part of the monastery.  Signs of the hands of Roger and Walfred, witnesses living under Salic law.
Signs of the hands Amezo, Arninus, Aymonis, Rubaldus, Opizon, witnesses.
I, as above Giselbertus, notary of the holy palace, writer of this charter of donation completed and gave it, subsequently delivered.(2)
