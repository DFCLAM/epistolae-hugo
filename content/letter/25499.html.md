<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>This is the agreement which was made between lord Raymond count of Barcelona and lady Almodis countess and the children of said count Raymond, and viscount Raymond Bernard and viscountess Ermengard his wife and their children, for the whole honor of Razès and of Carcassonne [and of Narbonne] and of Minerve and of Toulouse, that was count Peter Raymond’s and his son Roger’s.&nbsp; Said viscount and viscountess agreed with said count and countess that if said viscount and [vis]countess died without children from legitimate marriage, or if those children similarly died without children from legitimate union, this whole said honor that was count Peter Raymond’s and his son Roger’s would revert to said count Raymond and countess Almodis or the children of said count Raymond.&nbsp; Also said count and countess agree that if said count Raymond dies without a child from legitimate marriage, or the children of said count Raymond die without children from legitimate marriage, similarly this whole said honor that was count Peter Raymond’s and his son Roger’s would revert to said viscount Raymond and to said viscountess Ermengard or to their children.&nbsp; They also agree between them that from this whole said honor one may not give or encumber anything to any man or woman, unless between them, one to the other, except to their men; nor can one of the abovenamed encumber anything from said honor unless between them one to the other; and if encumbered in this way from said honor, anyone of these named above may redeem the mortgage, make and hold this in mortgage only until the other to who should hold this mortgage redeems it.&nbsp;
