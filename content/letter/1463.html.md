And we the aforesaid give you, countess inscribed above and your inscribed-above son, that inscribed-above gift of these castles without deceipt for the evil we did to you and for …  And we make the agreement with you and approve that you detain our brother Peter Roger in these towns, from the above-inscribed towns until he gives you, you Rangard and your son Roger, his third part of the castle Mirepoix, as much as he has there and should have and and that aforesaid Peter gives and affirms half of that castle which they call Prouille, that half which we give to you and let this all be done without deceipt.
