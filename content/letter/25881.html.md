<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Alix, duchess of Burgundy.&nbsp; To all to whom these present letters should come, greetings.&nbsp; We make known that the noble man our friend and faithful Erard of Chacenay swore on the holy [relics] to our dearest and most faithful the noble lady Blanche, illustrious countess palatine of Troyes and the noble man, her son Thibaut, count palatine of Champagne and Brie that he will help them against any creature that might live and die, and also swore especially that he will help the countess and count against the queen of Cyprus and her heirs, and against her husband, if she should perhaps marry someone, and against all creatures who, in a dispute of that queen or her heirs or her husband, if perhaps she had a husband, or in a dispute over the right which said queen says she has or her husband, if perhaps she had a husband, or the heirs of that queen say they have in the county of Champagne and Brie or its appurtenances, might wish to harm said countess Blanche and count Thibaut or the heirs of that count Thibaut or their land by bringing suit or war or in any other way.</p><p>That Erard swore also that he will not be an aid or counsellor or accomplice to said queen nor to her husband if perhaps she had a husband, nor to the heirs of that queen, that that queen or her husband or any heir of that queen or other [person] in a dispute with them might oppose said countess and count or the heirs of that count through a suit or war or any other mode, for the right which said queen says she had in the county of Champagne and Brie and its appurtenances, or the right which her husband or heirs of that queen say they have over the premises.&nbsp; And all these mentioned above that Erard promised as liege man of said countess and count, and swore that he would firmly observe these in perpetuity to them and the heirs of the oftmentioned count.&nbsp; That all these written above be firmly observed by said Erard and commended to perpetual memory strengthened by our seal, we have had the present page written at the request of said Erard and strengthened with the protection of our seal.&nbsp; Enacted in the year of grace 1222, on the octave of Easter.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Alaidis ducissa Burgundie.
