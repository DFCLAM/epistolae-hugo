<h2> Translated letter:</h2>He fears certainly very much and rightly dreads to exercize secular military service against the profession of his order; to defend the land, to engage in battles and arms is for the earthly power.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Nimium certe veretur et  iure formidat contra professionem sui ordinis secularem miliciam exercere; terram defendere, de preliis tractare, de armis terrenae potestatis est.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The pope writes about a bishop who refuses to take part in military action.
