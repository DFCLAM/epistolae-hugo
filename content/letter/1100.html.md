<h2> Translated letter:</h2>We, Margaret countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, make known to all that it is welcome and accepted by us and we hold it valid, we consider the dissent thus far held between our dearest daughter Adele, formerly wife of our most beloved son John of Avesnes on one side, and on the other lord Godfrey of Cruninghes, lord Peter and lord Henry of Versailles, brothers, to be settled, and we should not, through us or at our provocation, vindicate hereafter in some respect the wrongdoing or trouble inflicted by the aforesaid knights on the said Adele, our daughter, which we declare to those present.
	Granted in the year of the Lord 1265, Saturday after the Ascension of the Lord.(1)
