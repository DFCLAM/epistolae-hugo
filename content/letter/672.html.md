<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Commission to the said Geoffrey [de Langele], Henry [de Bretton] and Nicholas [de Turri], or two of them, to make partitions amongst the heirs of said earl [of Chester] of the houses, services, rents, homages and lands which Clemence, sometime countess of Chester, held in dower of the gift of the earl on the day of her death.  They are to meet on the morrow of St. Peter's Chains at Repindun:  and for the greater evidence of the said partition the king is sending to them, with the assent of the heirs, extents of the said lands.
Mandate to the queen and R. earl of Cornwall, if any of the heirs refuse to abide by the share assigned to him by the justices, to compel him to do so according to law.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry left the government of England in the hands of Eleanor, with the counsel of his brother, Richard of Cornwall.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
