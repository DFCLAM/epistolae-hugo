<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I G[uillelma] Matilda, duchess, make manifest to all by these letters the gift which I make for my lord of good memory, Duke Hugo of Burgundy to the holy protomartyr Stephen and those serving him.&nbsp; I grant to them in the Villa of Asnieres the manses of that saint, and the men living in them, free and clear of all custom and charge or request from me and ducal ministers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I confirm to them and their men that they hold the land of that saint, in woods as well as open country , as it is known now or may become known, in that freedom.&nbsp; If anyone from our manses wished to cross over to their manses to live, he might cross and love freely and without claim.&nbsp; This was done in the chapter of Dijon on the third Sunday of Lent, by the hand of Abbot Herbert, with [the following] present:&nbsp; Garner, provost, and other canons with knights and servants; William of Orgiul and Wido of Nucher, Guido of Moreil and his brother Cavino, and Huon of Echirey, William, provost of the viscount, Walter and Pagano toll-takers, Natali, and William, cleric, Hugo Follen, and Migeo.&nbsp; He did this first and reinvested it by the staff [baculum] , with [the following] present:&nbsp; Raynald Bigot, Cavino Bornot of Asnieres, Raynald and Oldemar of Asnieres.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego G.
