<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To his excellent lady Blanche, countess palatine of Troyes and his dearest friend Thibaut, count of Champagne, her son, William count of Mâcon and Vienne, [sends] greetings and prompt will to service.&nbsp; Your distinction should know that my dearest wife countess Scolastica with my consent and will and that of my sons, chose to be buried in the abbey of Miroir, and with my and my children’s will and consent, assigned to that abbey the revenue which she has from your fairs, namely a hundred fifty pounds as long as she lives.&nbsp; From that revenue, she conferred on said church 20 pounds of annual and perpetual revenue, with our will and approval, in perpetual alms.&nbsp; After her death, however, that revenue will revert to me or my heirs without opposition, except for the said twenty pounds that will remain to said church in perpetuity.&nbsp; Moreover we grant that said church will receive said revenue in its entirety in the first two years for the remedy of her soul and her ancestors, whatever happens to the countess. And so that this remain firm in perpetuity, we ask you that you have this sent in writing, fortified with your seal, to the lord abbot of Miroir and invest him with it on our part.&nbsp; Enacted in the 1218th year of the Lord, on the 17th kalends of January.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p><span style="line-height: 1.5; background-color: transparent;">Excellenti domine sue B(lanche) comitisse Trecensis palatine et amico suo karissimo Theob(aldo) comiti Campanie nato ejus, W(illelmus) comes Masticonensis et Vihennis salutem, et promptam ad obsequia voluntatem.
