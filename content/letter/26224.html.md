<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and future to whose notice the present writing will have come, greetings in the bestower of salvation to all.&nbsp; The office of reginal benevolence admonishes and induces us to meet with worthy retribution responding favorably to the merits of those who gave us loyalties and services opportunely with willing spirit since, when we offer favor and assent to their labors and services honorably, we invite others to more ample deeds of loyalty by similar example, and we render to the prompt very promptly; therefore we wish to make manifest to the notice of all of you by the contents of the presents, that we expecting and wishing to respond to the loyalties and services of the noble man count Benedict son of count/<i>ispán</i> Iwanche (Ivánka) who, not fearing to commit his person to the course of fortune in prosperous and adverse circumstances to lord Béla and lord Stephen, renowned kings of Hungary and lately to lord king Ladislaus, our dearest son, and to us, laudably with consummate diligence, in recompense to him for his services and some payment of retribution, though he might be worthy of greater generosity,&nbsp; we have given, donated, and conferred a certain land called lower Urbua in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Pozsega pertaining to our granting, which Mortunus son of Myke formerly held with all its uses and appurtenances, on that count Benedict and through him on his heirs and their successors to be possessed perpetually and irrevocably, with the good will of that lord Ladislaus, king, our dearest son and the consent of his barons with certain knowledge.&nbsp; The boundaries of that land, lower Urboa are designated in this way.&nbsp; The first boundary begins in the south beside the river Churnuch from an oak (<i>thul)</i> tree in which there is a cross, thence it proceeds northward into Zava forest through trees signed by a cross and coming out of that wood where it extends to a field and there is a land boundary under a <i>thul</i> tree, thence it goes north to a land boundary, thence goes down through a field eastward to a land boundary, from here it goes to a nut tree beside the Urbua river having a certain stone among the leaves (interfrondens), thence having crossed the Urbua river it goes to another nut tree signedby a cross, thence it nears a certain road beside which is a land boundary from there it extends eastward to a certain rise (<i>berch)</i> where there is a land boundary thence it turns east where it crosses a certain creek under a <i>nar </i>tree a land boundary, thence to a pear tree signed with the cross, then it falls into a creek called Bokoleznyk and up to that creek it shares a continual boundary with the land of higher Urbua, and there it begins to share with the land of count Cheh, thence it proceeds through the course of that creek south to a great road which comes from Urbua, where there is a land boundary, then it goes along the road to the east and falls into the Zlopchenyk water in which it goes south where there is a land boundary, thence it proceeds southward in that water and comes out towards the east and from there turns again to the south under Dastiulaz where there is a <i>syl</i>&nbsp; tree as a boundary, from there it proceeds south to Dobouch creek and crosses that Doboch creek eastward and goes to a <i>tul</i> tree signed with a cross which is for a boundary and there falls onto a great road a course that goes south to Treztenapola and crossing that field comes to the Luky water where there is a <i>tul</i> tree signed with a cross and in that Luky water it goes southward to a place called a Heleusca polya and from there it goes out eastwards and moves south to the Churnuch waters and on the other side of the water in that place the Zauyna water falls into the Churnuch and there is separated from the Cheh land, thence it progresses and goes west, it comes to a prior boundary and there it ends.&nbsp; So that this grant may remain unbroken and cannot be undone by anyone in the course of time, we have granted the present letters to that count Benedict fortified by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of master Gregory our faithful chancellor of our court in the thousand two hundred seventy fifth year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>E]lyzabeth dei gracia regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam futuris ad quorum noticiam presens scriptum peruenerit salutem in salutis omnium largitore.&nbsp;
