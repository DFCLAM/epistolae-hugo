<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary.&nbsp; To all the faithful of Christ to whom the present letters will be shown, greetings in him who is the true salvation of all.&nbsp; The majesty of princes, sollicitous to provide for individual subjects, should give special care particularly to those who offered themselves with most devoted services to the highness of princes, always prompt and obedient before others.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all present and future by the content of these:&nbsp; that since count/<i>ispán</i> Lawrence, grandson of Vécs, a noble of the Zovárd kin, from the first times of his adolescence gave and showed many and various services with the highest loyalty and devotion to the most excellent princess lady Mary, illustrious former queen of Hungary, of happy memory, and the most serene lady E[lizabeth] widow of the magnificent prince lord Stephen illustrious king of Hungary, our dearest father-in-law, and finally to our highness, exposing his person to the chances of fortune with various services to those queens and to us:&nbsp; We, in the function of the rule we accepted, should measure the merits of individuals for their faithful and deserving services given to said queens in their persons [and] to our sublimity; which which are too numerous to list here separately; wishing [to make] some recompense for his services with reginal favor, though he should be raised with greater remuneration and wealth by reginal generosity; yet so that others urged by the example may be inspired more strongly to giving services of loyalty to us in future, we have given, donated, and conferred a certain reginal land of ours called Mocs (Mooch) beside the Danube, in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Komárom, in the neighborhood of the land called Kónya, and of the nobles of Mocs beside the Danube, in which our heralds/criers resided, with all their usages and appurtenances, namely arable lands, hayfields and meadows, island, fisheries, which are called <i>Tanya</i> in the vulgate, from the fullness of our grace to that count/<i>ispán </i>Lawrence and through him to his heirs and successors of those heirs, to be possessed irrevocably perpetually and peacefully, in that manner and fullness as that land is known to have been possessed in past times by donation and grant of said queens – and from whose generosity it was first conferred, under those boundaries and limits in which our said heralds/criers possessed it from the times of said lady queen Maria without disturbance from anyone.&nbsp; grant of that land to whomever the times of said lady queen Maria without disturbance from anyone.&nbsp; Revoking and withdrawing by the authority of the presents all our letters made earlier on the granting of that land by us to whomever if they went against this in the past.&nbsp; So that the content of this donation of ours may obtain the force of perpetual stability, and cannot be&nbsp; withdrawn in some respects by anyone in the course of time, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dasted by the hand of the venerable father Philip, bishop by the grace of God our faithful, chancellor of our court.&nbsp; In the 1274th year of the Lord.&nbsp; Fifth kalends of June.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth regina, Dei gratia Hungarie.&nbsp;
