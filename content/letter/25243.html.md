<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the holy and individual trinity, of the father and son and holy spirit.&nbsp; Be it known to all men future as well as present an exchange made between the house of the hospital and the abbess named Joveta of St. Lazarus of Bethany.&nbsp; That exchange was done by this agreement which I, Raymond, master of the hospital, with the counsel of the whole chapter of brother clerics and laymen, grant and approve to the abbess of St. Lazarus and all her nuns every tithe which the Hospital had in the village of Bethany and in all its appurtenances in exchange for a certain vineyard which she bestowed on us for that tithe, and I, Joveta, abbess of St. Lazarus give, approve and grant to the Hospital in exchange for that tithe a certain vineyard which faces the vineyard of the Hospital in the east, in the south the vineyard of St. Ann, in the north the road which goes to Nablus, and runs from the vineyard to the fork of St. Stephen.&nbsp; These are the enclosing abutments.&nbsp; So I, Joveta, abbess of St. Lazarus with the counsel/council (1) of our lady nuns and our whole chapter, approve and grant said exchange to lord Raymond, and the other brothers, present and future, in perpetuity.&nbsp; Moreover lady Avis, abbess of St. Mary the Great, with the concession and will of her nuns, namely Odolina, Solis, and Gundelena, and all the other ladies, granted and gave to the Hospital in good faith and without deceit half the tithe which she had in the said vineyard, in the sight and hearing of Peter of St. Lazarus, Lambert, exchanger, and Stephen Humbert.&nbsp; By the same agreement, lady Sibylla, abbess of St. Anna, with the concession and will of Ermengard and Gilia and her other nuns, gave and granted to the Hospital the other half of the tithe which she had in the forenamed vineyard in the presence of Ralph of St. Peter and William Ebrald and Amisarno, butcher.&nbsp; This was done in the 1157th year from the incarnation of the lord, with Fulcher as patriarch and Baldwin ruling as fourth king of Jerusalem.&nbsp; Witnesses of this were:&nbsp; Odolina prioress, lady Siguina Romana, Alamandina, chantress, Helen nun, and Agnes, nun.</p><p>All these were established in the presence of lady queen Melisende.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext41">In Nomine Sanctae, &amp;
