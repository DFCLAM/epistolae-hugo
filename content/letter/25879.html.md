<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I Philippa daughter of the late count of Troyes, Henry of bright memory, wife of the lord Erard of Brienne.&nbsp; I make known to all who will look at the present letters that I approve and hold firm the truces and agreements made over those truces between my husband Erard of Brienne and me on one side, and Blanche, said countess palatine of Troyes and Thibaut her son on the other, in the war which was waged between us and them, as contained in the letters on the promises sealed by the seal of my said lord and mine.&nbsp; At the command of that same my lord and my own will, I have sworn that I will keep in good faith all that is contained in the past letters of my lord, and work to see that all the above are firmly observed.&nbsp; Enacted at Faucogney in the 1218th year of the lord in the month of July.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego Philippa H(enrici) clare memorie quondam comitis Trecensis filia uxor domini Erardi de Brena.
