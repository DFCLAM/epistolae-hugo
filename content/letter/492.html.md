<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[summary]  Notification to the queen of France that the king has appointed P. bishop of Hereford, P. de Sabaudia and J. Maunsell treasurer of York, to procure the said estimate to be made quickly; and as the king thinks that the matter will be furthered by her mediation, he requests her to use her influence with her lord, as the said proctors will explain.
The like to the countess of Provence.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>During the rebellion of Simon de Montfort, the king and queen of France were involved in mediations for Henry.  Peter of Savoy and John Mansell were involved in arrangements for the English royal jewels, deposited in the Temple in Paris.  This cryptic announcement of his envoys may refer to those negotiations.  The summary is given only in English.
