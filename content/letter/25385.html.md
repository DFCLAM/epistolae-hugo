<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext51">In the name of the lord.&nbsp; I, Th[eoderic] by the grace of God count of Holland, and A[leide] my wife, by that same grace countess of Holland, wish to make known to all that we have granted the brothers of the church of Villers-en-Brabant, in respect of the sacred religion by which they are known to operate, for the salvation of our souls and those of our ancestors, that they be free from every collection of toll and conduct or passage for all the things which they buy in our land for the use of the church and which they carry through our land.&nbsp; That this may remain stable in posterity and be kept untroubled from all our successors, we have conferred the present page on this to the church, protected by the appending of our seals.&nbsp; Enacted in the 1202nd year from the lord’s incarnation.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext51">In nomine Domini.
