<h2> Translated letter:</h2>From this hour forward, I count Raymond son of Beliard, shall not harm countess Rangard, daughter of Amelia in her life, her members which she carries in her body and that hold themselves in her body, not by a crime or without one.  Nor shall I,  the above-inscribed Raymond, not my men, woman or women by my counsel or by trickery; and if there is a man or men, woman or women who might do this, I Raymond will not have peace nor fellowship, nor friendship or keep it or have it with him or them or her or them (f), who wished to take or did take from you, the above-inscribed Rangard, your life or your member.  And if there is a man or woman who wished to do this, I above-inscribed Raymond would make it known to you if I knew it without deceiving you, before harm came to you.  Above-inscribed Raymond will not take from above-inscribed Rangard that city of Beziers, nor the one they call Agde, nor the city of Carcassone, nor those walls or towers or fortifications which are in those above-inscribed cities and will be made there in future, I shall not take them, nor take them from you, or treat you badly or harm you over them, nor those castles which are in above-inscribed cities, nor those bishoprics which are in above-inscribed cities, nor those above-inscribed towers, walls or fortifications, I shall not take them or take them from you, I above-inscribed Raymond will not harm you countess Rengard, nor treat you badly, not I above-inscribed Raymond nor any man or woman by my counsel or trickery; I shall not have, hold or make peace nor fellowship nor any friendship with those men or women who do this and I shall be an aid to you above-inscribed Rangard without deception and I shall not deceive you about this aid in any way, until you above-inscribed Rangard have recovered those above-inscribed cities and those bishoprics and those above-inscribed castles and those towers and those above-inscribed fortifications, and I shall keep this oath from now on.  And if I said Raymond am able to recover those cities and bishoprics and castles and towers and said foritifications, I shall hand them over into the power of Rangard without deception and without payment.  And I Raymond will not harm Rangard in that castle of Peyrissas, nor in the castle of St. Tyberius, nor the castle of St. Pons of Maiorciac, nor in the castle of Meios, or the castle of Pojetto-Ingeleno, nor the castle of Paullo, nor the castle of Marezes , nor the castle of Moderais, nor the castle of Nizianis, nor the castle of Poyano,  nor the castle of Mercoirel, nor the castle of Cariis, nor the castle of Vilzano, nor the castle of Rocabrun, nor the castle of Abelino, nor the fortifications which are in said castles or will be made there in the future, I shall not take nor take from you nor permit no man or woman, men or women by my counsel or my trickery [to take them].  And if there is a man, or men, woman or women, who would take or permit that those castles or anything in them [be taken] from you said Rangard, I said Raymond will not have peace or fellowship with them until those castles are recovered and I shall be an aid to you in faith without deception or payment.  As is written above, so I Raymond will hold and observe to you Rangard, with and without crime, if I did not see you confirmed in my life or members, or those cities or castles which you wished to take from me or had taken or restored in battle.  As is written above, I Raymond will hold this and observe it to you Rangard, except as you shall absolve me at your pleasure without force and in full knowledge.
