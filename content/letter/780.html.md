<h2> Translated letter:</h2>The king to G., lord of Blay, greetings.  We order you and strictly command that you have conducted safely by all your power the messengers and men of our beloved B[erengaria] former queen of England, those going from her to Spain and those coming to her from Spain carrying letters of hers or with her name.  Do not permit them to be harmed by anyone in anything.
Witnessed by H[enry] etc., as above.

Mandamus vobis et districte precipimus quatinus nuncios et homines dilecte nobis B. quondam regine Anglie, euntes ab ipsa in Hispaniam et de Hispania ad ipsam venientes, litteras ipsius deferentes vel nomen suum tenentes, per totam potestatem vestram salvo conduci faciatis.  Nec permittatis eos ab aliquibus in aliquo molestari.  Teste H. etc. ut supra.
