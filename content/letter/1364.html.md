<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I Alix Duchess of Burgundy make known to all who will look at the present letters that I did homage to lord Durand, bishop of Chalon because of my illness, since at that time I was detained seriously in my home in the mountain of Talant, save by the right and honor of the church of Chalon.  Enacted in this 1218th year of grace in the month of September.
