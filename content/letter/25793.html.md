<h2> Translated letter:</h2><div><p>Milo, provost, Stephen deacon, F. cantor, and the other brothers of the church of Reims, to all to whom these letters will come, greetings in the Lord.&nbsp; We make known to all that such a peace has been made between us and lady Blanche, countess of Champagne, about the town of Ponte:&nbsp; namely, that from the fires/burnings which men in our land made or might make, to the boundaries placed by our beloved Odo, marshal of Champagne and Guy Pes-lupi, our fellow canon, who are the arbiters of this, we shall have a twelfth sheath for land-tax; and that land-tax the men in the town of Ponte bring into the town of Ponte, to the grange which we shall have there, if we so wish, and they will not be held to bring it outside the town.&nbsp; – In that town we shall have one serving free from military service, toll, writ and cavalry.&nbsp; And that one servant will protect our things in everything in which we have or shall have a right. – Moreover the meadows, which owe us the customary right that men are accustomed to have from jurisdiction, the men will hold from power and those who are outside the jurisdiction will give us the customary dues and debt of the land. – Whoever [is] an inhabitant of that town, who has an oven and a place, will give us, on the feast of St. Martin, as is the custom, one measure of oats in the measure in which the men of Maurimont give their customary dues, and one capon, for use-fees of our woods and waters, and nothing more can be exacted from them for the named usages. – We indeed will have in our domain our arable lands, meadows, waters and woods, as we are known to have had up to now, except that in those woods the men of that town will have their usage to burn and build, as the men of Maurimont have there; and moreover they will have their fires/burnings there which they have done and will do, up to the boundaries which the said arbiters, marshal Odo and Guido set. – And if those arbiters are missing&nbsp; or dead, in their place we will choose one and the said countess another to set the said boundaries.&nbsp; – That this may remain in force and stable, we have had the present letters written and strengthened by the affixing of our seal.&nbsp; Enacted in the year of grace 1212, in the month of October.</p></div><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Milo prepositus, Stephanus decanus, F. cantor, ceterique Remensis ecclesie fratres, omnibus ad quos littere iste pervenerint in Domino salutem.&nbsp; – Notum facimus universis quod talis pax facta est inter nos et dominam Blancham, comitissam, Campanie, de villa de Ponte: videlicet, quod de exartis que homines in terra nostra fecerunt aut facient, usque ad metas quas dilecti nostri Odo marescallus Campanie, et Guido Pes-lupi, concanonicus noster, ponent, qui ex hoc sunt dictores, habebimus duo-decimam garbam pro terragio; et illud terragium ducent homines intra villam de Ponte, ad grangiam quam ibi habebimus, si voluerimus, nec extra villam ducere tenebuntur. — In eadem villa habebimus unum servientem liberum ab exercitu, tallia, tolta et chevalchcia.
