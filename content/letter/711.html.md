<h2> Translated letter:</h2>"To B, queen, daughter of the illustrious former king of Castile."

<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>This letter is dated after the death of king John of England (October 1216), which effectively ended Blanche's claims to the English throne, and before the death of her brother, Henry of Castile (1217), which gave her some claim to the throne of Castile.  This protection presumably refers to her dower lands.
