<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Prohibition to the good men of Gernemuth, as they love their lands, from molesting the barons of Winchelese and la Rye or others of the Cinque Ports at their instant fair of Gernemuth on account of contentions between them, or from disturbing the realm during the king’s absence, and if they presume to attempt anything contrary to this prohibition the king will betake himself to their bodies, wives and their little ones and said lands, so that they shall feel it for ever. And if the lesser persons of their town inflict any harm upon the said barons, the king will betake himself to them, the greater, as though they had themselves offended by their negligence or default. When the king is ready he will do justice touching their contentions.
Attested by Queen Eleanor and R. earl of Cornwall.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
