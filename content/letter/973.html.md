<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[Again about his gift]
If you do not complete what is here called complete,
I ask, as a suppliant, receive this, take it willingly.
Do not spurn what is small:  for if you ask of my desires,
broader love is found in a narrow gift.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>[Item de munere suo]
Si non conplestis quod hic conpleta vocatur,
haec, rogo suppliciter, suscipe, sume libens.
nec parva spernas:  nam si mea vota requiras,
munus in angustum cernitur amplus amor.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>Bishop Venantius Fortunatus met Agnes and her patron Radegund when he visited Poitiers. They became good friends and exchanged epistolary poems and small gifts until the women died.
