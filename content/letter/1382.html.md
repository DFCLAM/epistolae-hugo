<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Alix, duchess of Burgundy, to all her provosts and bailiffs, greetings and love.  We command you and firmly order that to the abbot of Saint-Seine, our dearest friend, you give our counsel in all his affairs and help and whatever he enjoins on us and vindicate him from whatever injury is done him as if we enjoined you with our own mouth, while he may bear the surety for the ordered place and time of what you will have done at his command.  Enacted in the 1220th year of grace in the month of November.
