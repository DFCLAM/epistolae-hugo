<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the Lord.&nbsp; I, Raymond, count of Barcelona, and Almodis, countess, and Raymond, our son, give you, Raymond Bernard, viscount, and your [his] wife&nbsp; Ermengard and your children in fief all those fiefs and the whole honor that Peter Raymond, count, and his son Roger held and had, and men through them, in the county of Carcassonne and in the county of Toulouse through the count of Toulouse, except the city of Carcassonne and those townships that are in its circuit and except those churches that are in that city and in those townships, and except those lands that give tithes and first fruits to those churches which are in that city and in those townships, and except the bishopric and as much as pertains to that bishopric; but that bishop must be the man of Raymond Bernard and swear fidelity to him, saving [his] fidelity to said count and countess and their son Raymond, and if he gives or will give a prize for said bishopric by any artifice, Raymond, said viscount or his wife or their children should have half of that price or that gift; and except the abbacies of St. Mary of Lagrasse and St.Hilarius, and as much as pertains to those abbacies and except that viscounty of Carcassonne and as much as pertains to that viscounty.&nbsp; And if said count Raymond or countess Almodis or their son Raymond of their posterity should send a viscount into said viscounty, that viscount must be the man of said viscount Raymond and swear fidelity to him, saving [his] fidelity to said count and countess and their son Raymond; and he would take half of that viscounty from the hand of said viscount Raymond and his wife Ermengard and their posterity, except that of the city of Carcassonne and its townships and except all the mills and milling rights and except that riverbank with its head waters and appurtenances and meadows and pastures and all the other things of said boundary of said Carcassonne.</p><p>And we, said count and countess and our said son, give you, said Raymond, viscount, and Ermengard, viscountess, and your posterity that abbey of St. John of Valséguier and the election of said abbacy, and the whole right of procuration of that abbey and of its whole honor and as much as pertains to that abbey or ought to in all places and as much as we have or ought to have in that abbey or in its dominions, in fief, except for that service that you owe us.&nbsp; And again we give you in the whole said county of Carcassonne and as much as pertains to that county and ought to pertain, half of all those judgments (justicias), except for those men and women who are or will be in said city of Carcassonne for guard duty or are in those townships which are in its circuit, and except the judgments of those markets of that city and of said townships outside of that city and homicide or breaking peace and some other suit for which battle might be waged in the said townships and said boundary.&nbsp; Similarly we give you half of those judgments and of those above-mentioned suits, in such a way that the count of Carcassonne may hear the suit and give the judgments and from what comes out of the suits and judgments, you said viscount and viscountess and your posterity would have a whole half.&nbsp; And if the count of Carcassonne does not make or does not wish to make those judgments or hear those suits, you, said Raymond and Ermenard and your posterity, may hear those suits and make those judgments and take half of them and give the other half to the count of Carcassonne.&nbsp; Again we, said count and countess, give you, said Raymond and Ermengard and your posterity, the whole tribute of said abbey of Valséguier and half of all the other tributes and all those tolls which are and will be in said county of Carcassonne and in its boundaries, except for the city of Carcassonne and those townships and markets within the said boundary of said city.&nbsp; And in those judgments and tributes and those tolls from said county let us be, between us one to the other, helpers without deception.&nbsp; And if we, said count and countess or our son, who will be count of Carcassonne, could acquire the abbey of St. Peter of Caunes of the count of Rodez, we give you, said viscount Raymond and Ermengard and your posterity, said abbey and the election and right of procuration and as much as pertains and ought to pertain to said abbey in fief and the other rights of procuration of said county, except the above abbeys and what pertains to them, except that what one releases to another, we shall divide in half with the counsel of our good men by firm faith without deception.&nbsp; And said count and countess may not seize said abbey of Caunes and what pertains to it for&nbsp; said Raymond, viscount, nor his wife or their men, until they acquire said abbey from the count of Rodes; and said viscount Raymond may not, nor his wife, deny the count of Rodes that gift of said abbey, in order to give said abbey to said count or countess and their son that will be count of said Carcassonne.&nbsp; This charter of donation and agreement was made on VI nones of March in the year 1067 of the Lord’s incarnation, in the reign of king Phlip.&nbsp; Sign+ of Gaucelin Arnall.&nbsp; S. of Bernard Azedmar.&nbsp; Peter, priest, who wrote this document of bestowal as asked, and subscribed it on the day and year stated.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">In nomine Domini.
