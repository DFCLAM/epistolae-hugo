<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[summary]  Charter granting to Beatrice, countess of Provence, the king's mother, for life the manor of Fekenham, which Henry, earl of Arundel, surrendered to the king as his escheat of the lands of Normans, for her to dispose of the issues at her will.  And if, in her lifetime, the lands of England and Normandy become one, the king will not disseise her before making her an exchange in escheats or other lands to a like value.  Witnesses:  John son of Geoffrey, John de Plesseto, John de Lexinton, Guy de Russiluny and others.
Mandate to the archbishop of York to give her seisin.
