Ego, Guillelmus Raimundi, filius Adale, comitisse de Cerritania, donator et diffinitor et evacuator sum vobis, domno Raimundo, comiti Barcheone, et domne Adalmodi, comitisse. Satis est verum et multis bene cognitum, quia ego accepi uxorem Adalaidem, que fuit filia Petri Raimundi, comitis Biterrensis, et Rangardis, comitissa, dedit mihi omnem suum directum et omnes suas voces, quas predictus Petrus, comes, vir suus, dederat et dimiserat ei in civitate Carcassone et in toto comitatu et episcopatu Carcassone sive in Redes et in toto comitatu de Redes et in omnibus finibus eius, tam in castellis quam in omnibus aliis edificiis et in omnibus terris montuosis et planis. Et dedit mihi eciam prefata Rengardis, cum predicta filia sua, omne directum et omnes voces quas ipsa Adalaidis proclamabat et habebat et habere debebat in prelibata civitate et in supradictis comitatibus et episcopatibus sive in omnibus rebus supradictis et pertinenciis cunctis. Et ego, supradictus Guillelmus, per hanc meam donacionis et evacuacionis ac diffinicionis scripturam dono vobis ac diffinio et personam prefate Adalaidis et omne directum et omnes voces, quas per prefatam Rangardem, comitissam, et per filiam suam supradictam Adalaidem habeo et habere debeo in omnibus supradic­tis comitatibus et episcopatibus et abbaciis et in cunctis rebus aliis supranominatis ; et trado hoc totum in vestrum dominium eternaliter ad haben­dum et quod volueritis faciendum sine ulla reservacione et absque ullo vestro enganno. Et voluntarie sic me vacuo, tam ex predictis personis quam ex supradictis cunctis aliis rebus, atque diffinio, ut nunquam ibi aliquod requiram vel retineam nec habeam nec ego nec ullus homo per me. Et accipio a vobis pro hac donacione libenti animo et pro hac diffinicione et evacuacione quatuor millia mancusos Barchinonenses. Ideoque, qui hoc vobis voluerit disrumpere aut per quemcumque modum tollere, nullo modo possit facere, sed pro sola presumpcione in duplo hoc vobis totum componat, et postea hec scriptura firma permaneat. Actum est hoc vi kalendas ianuarii anno VIII regni Philippi regis. Sig+num Guillelmi Raimundi, qui hanc donacionis vel diffinicionis sive evacuacionis scripturam fieri iussi et firmavi et testes firmare rogavi.&nbsp; Sig+num Raimundi Guillelmi vicecomitis.&nbsp; Petrus, presbiter, qui hoc scripsit et subscripsit die annoque prenotato.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>William Raymond, count of Cerdagne, gives his wife’s lands and his wife, Adelaide, Almodis’s niece, to the count and countess of Barcelona for 4000 Barcelona marks.&nbsp; Cheyette (“The `Sale’,” 834-35) notes that Adelaide did not relinquish her claims until 1070 (see LFM #822), after which she dropped out of sight.&nbsp; Cheyette’s article analyzes the complications of the various Carcassonne transactions.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>LFM 2.298-99, #815.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1067, December 27
