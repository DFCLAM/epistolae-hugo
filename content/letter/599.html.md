<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Royal assent to the election of William de Wytchirche, cellarar of Persore, to be abbot of Alencestre, directed to W. bishop of Worcester.
By the queen and earl.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
<h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><em>Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry III, 1247-58</em>, 4.362; summary in English.(1)</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>12/29/1253
