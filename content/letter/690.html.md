<h2> Translated letter:</h2>It is charged to the lady queen and to Richard, count of Cornwall, that, since John of Baillol is detained with the king in his service in Gascony and wants his rights in England to be protected, they have assigned without delay that portion of the lands and holdings that were Eleanor's, once countess of Chester, which pertain to that John by hereditary right, not permitting that his absence cause any injury to him in the dividing of those lands and holdings.  Witness as above.  Witness the King.
In camp outside La RÃ©ole, 8th day of September, etc.
