<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Request to all the archbishops and bishops of Ireland to meet this Mid-Lent at Dublin before John son of Geoffrey, justiciary of Ireland, whom the king is sending for this reason to those parts, to hear the king’s will about the business of the king of Castile, who is preparing to attack Gascony next Easter with an army of Christians and Saracens and if he gain this, then England and Ireland. The justiciary will explain this to them more fully by word of mouth as to the other magnates of Ireland whom the king has enjoined to treat of the same matter with the counsel and aid of the clergy. Before that day they are to consider how they can best assist the king in his excusable necessity with their goods, and they are to induce their subjects to come to the king’s aid munificently in his great need and danger, because at no future time, by the permission of God, will he so much require the aid of his friends as he needs it at present.
By the Queen, earl and the whole council.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
