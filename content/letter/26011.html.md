<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To her beloved lord and friend, O venerable bishop of Cambrai, Clementia, countess of Flanders by the grace of God, whatever there may be of health and all good.&nbsp; We make known to your eminence about that place which the inhabitants of Audenarde wish to construct in your diocese to the service and honor of God, that my lord count and I agree and desire it in every way, and hand over that place altogether free, as much as pertains to us, and make it free from those children to whom it pertains by hereditary right, before their barons and ours, by general and canonic concession to those parts when we have died, with God’s help.&nbsp; The holiness of your fatherhood is entreated over this in everyway as much as pertains to you, to kindly approve the enterprise, so that that place may be established to the service and honor of God as we mentioned, by the privilege of your authority with firmest freedom, so that afterwards, with all dispute put to rest, services to God and the saints may be held there.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Dilecto domino et amico suo, o! venerabili episcopo Cameracensium, Clementia, Flandrie comitissa Dei gratia, quicquid est salutis et omne bonum. Notum facimus discretioni vestre de loco illo, quem cives de Aldenarda construere volunt, in vestra diocesi, ad servicium et honorem Dei, quia dominus meus comes et ego nos inquantum omnimodis acquiescimus et volumus, et quantum ad nos pertinet, locum illum liberum omnino dimittimus, et eandem libertatem ab ipsis pueris, ad quos hereditario jure hoc attinet, coram baronibus eorum et nostris generali concessione et canonica ad partes illas cum primum declinaverimus, Deo opitulante, faciemus.&nbsp; Vestre igitur paternitatis sanctitas super hoc omnimodis exorata, quantum attinet ad vos, ad hoc perficiendum clementer adnitatur, ut locus ille ad Dei servicium, ut prelibavimus et honorem vestre auctoritatis privilegio firmissima libertate stabiliatur, ut post, sopita omni calumpnia, Deo sanctisque inibi deserviatur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The countess asks the bishop to endorse the building of a chapel by the people of Audenard on land she and the count have given for that purpose.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>&nbsp;<i>Cartulaire de l’abbaye d’Eename,</i> ed.
