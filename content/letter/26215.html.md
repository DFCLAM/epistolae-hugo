<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Maria by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present letters greetings/salvation in the true savior.&nbsp; Writings usually record the deeds of men, lest they be wiped from memory in the course of time.&nbsp; Therefore we bring to the notice of all present and future to whom the contents of the presents come that when we entered into the kingdom of Slavonia to order and lead the whole state of the duchy of our dearest son duke Béla, our faithful citizens from the mountain of Grecz laid out several problems to us.&nbsp; And we, wishing to relieve their problems mercifully, especially since that castle/<em>castrum</em> newly constructed and erected in the highest place of the duchy was known to be founded for the common use of the whole kingdom and the guarding of its boundary, induced by said rational reasons, so that the utility of said <em>castrum</em> might more fully and better increase, we forgave in perpetuity the debt of two hundred weights which the citizens of that <em>castrum</em> were held to pay annually to the ban* of the duchy, rendering them absolved from the debt of this payment of said money by the protection of my letters.&nbsp; Moreover we made the populace of that <em>castrum</em> free and exempt from all jurisdiction of episcopal dignity, otherwise ….. the venerable father Philip bishop of Zagreb, renounced orally what he had by right and by deed, in the presence of master Thobias provost, master Peter archdeacon, master Buza cantor, Prothasius castle-keeper and Stephen deacon of said place all agreeing, that by the gift of my right and the goods of the land by custom, the authority in the aforesaid be attributed.&nbsp; That therefore this donation made by us circumspectly might obtain perpetual strength of stability and those citizens might enjoy the grace of my generosity in the future, we have conferred the present letters fortified by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated in the thousand two hundred sixty first year from the incarnation of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Maria dei gracia regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus presentes litteras inspecturis salutem in vero salutari.&nbsp; Solent scriptis redigi facta hominum, ne processu temporis a memoria delabantur.
