<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>From this hour forward I, Peter Raymond, son of the woman Beatrice, shall be faithful to you, count William, my lord, son of countess Adela, and to your wife Sancia, daughter of the late countess Almodis, without fraud or any evil trick and without any deception and without artifice in righteous faith.&nbsp; And from this hour forward I, said Peter, will not deceive/betray you, said count and countess, in your life nor the limbs which are held in your body, not your districts or county, nor your <i>castros</i> or castles or cliffs or hills, developed or barren, earth and honor, allods or fiefs, which you, said count and countess have today and ought to have and will acquire in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp; And from this hour forward I shall not deceive/betray you, said count and countess in that <i>castrum</i> which is called Figols, nor in those fortifications that are in it or will be in the future.&nbsp; I will not take it from you nor dispute them with you, nor deceive/betray you about them, not I, said Peter, nor a man or men, woman or women, by my counsel or by my artifice.&nbsp; And if a man or men, woman or women, who would take from you, or deny all the above or anything from all the above, I, said Peter, from that hour forward would not have peace or alliance nor hold with him or them, her or them, until you, said count and countess have recovered the whole that you will have lost of all the above without deception.&nbsp; And said <i>castrum </i>and said fortifications of Figols I would not refuse or dispute you by any trick nor [would] anyone for me and with my consent; but I would give you power over it, without deception, you and yours whom you would wish and order, and this as many times as you requested by yourself or through your messengers or messenger.&nbsp; And similarly I would hold this and keep it in all the above, in which I have power, and all the castles and fortifications which I hold and shall hold or ought to hold through you, without deception, as was said.&nbsp; And I will be a help to you to hold and have and defend powerfully, without deception, as many times as you requested or commanded by yourself or through your messengers or messenger.&nbsp; I would not have or hold alliance with your enemies or enemy, male or female, infidel or infidels, to your harm, as far as I knew.&nbsp; I would not refuse or dispute justice with you by any trick of those or of mine.&nbsp; I would not reveal your counsel or counsels to your harm, as far as I knew.&nbsp; I would not make nor hold nor pledge faith to a lord or lords, and if I have done, I would not hold it without your allowing him or them to whom you would allow me freely.</p><p>As was written above, so after you I said Peter shall hold and keep it, without deception, to your son or daughter or him or her to whom you would leave the county of Berga (Bergitano) or ought to, in words or by the will you have after your death, and I would take it from his hand and commend myself to his hands and swear such oath to him as I swear today to you; and I would do this within the first 30 days in which you were dead and I knew it, without evil dispute and without any rewards, over the oaths and pledges and fealties and all the aforesaid.&nbsp; As is written above and below, I shall hold and keep it, without deception, to you, said count and countess, without deception, entirely, except what you absolve me of with willing spirit without any force.&nbsp; And because of what is written above, I Peter pledge to you, said count and countess, and to the aforesaid after your death, every fief or allod which I have or ought to have or anyone holds through me and I shall hold to that day in your whole land or honor, without deception, as I hold and keep all this to you or after you to them, without deception, as is written.&nbsp; Which if I should not do and keep as written, the pledge would be forfeit entirely into your power to do what you will with all of it and, after you to them, without trouble from me or others.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>De ista hora in antea ego, Petrus Remundi, filius qui sum Beatricis, femine, fidelis ero ad te, Guilielmum comitem, seniorem meum, filius qui es Adale comitisse, et ad uxorem tuam Sanciam, que fuit filia Almodis, comitisse, sine fraude et ullo malo ingenio et sine ulla decepcione et sine engan per directam fidem.
