<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Fenenna by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present letters greetings in the savior of all.&nbsp; It is fitting that reginal excellency give consideration of a good thing and with a view to eternal things raise the cultivation of the divine with the right hand of her generosity,&nbsp; so that in giving rewards she may commend her author [creator] who gave so much more as the glory of her rank will be seen to be increased by him. &nbsp;Thus we wish to bring to the notice of all by the contents of these that out of devotion and love of the divine name and of the glorious blessed virgin Mary mother of God, we have given, donated and conferred on the noble and religious ladies, holy sisters of the Island of the Blessed Virgin serving God constantly a certain reginal land of ours called Gumchud in the county of Alba/Fejér with all its uses and all appurtenances, namely meadows, fisheries and three islands, namely Fuen, Dyenus and Zumlov to be held and possessed peacefully in perpetuity by said sisters and through them by right the church of the Blessed Virgin of the Island.&nbsp; The boundaries of that land, as we saw contained in the letters of the chapter of Buda addressed&nbsp; to our dearest lord Andrew by the grace of God illustrious king of Hungary are defined in this way:&nbsp; the first boundary begins from the East beside the Danube and there are two old square markers/boundaries of which one defines the land of the chapter of the church of Buda called Saap, the other the land Gumchud, then it goes to the east to two markers/boundaries of which one defines and separates the land Opoy, thence southward to the great road which goes to the town Okozthov and there are two markers/boundaries.&nbsp; From there it goes south to two markers of which one divides the land Achad, thence to two markers of which one distinguishes Tetetken, thence northward to two markers of which one divides the land Halasci, from there towards a northern county to two markers which were erected beside the pinnacle of the church of St. Mark, of which one divides the land Dob, from there it goes to the port of the Danube and there are two square markers and so it ends.&nbsp; In witness of which thing and so that this present donation of ours may obtain the force of perpetual stability, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father lord Andrew by the grace of God bishop of Eger, our faithful chancellor, in the 1291st year of the lord, seventh kalends of August.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Fenenna Dei gratia regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus presentes litteras inspecturis salutem in omnium Salvatore.&nbsp;
