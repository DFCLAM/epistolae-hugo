<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Afterwards it was commanded to the queen and the earl of Cornwall to cause the said partition to be made by the justices appointed for this with the assent of the heirs, so that no seisin had by any of the said heirs of the said lands other than that to be assigned by the said justices shall be valid.  And when this partition has been made, they are in no wise to omit, for any previous deed or mandate, to compel any rebellious heir to abide by the share assigned to him.
