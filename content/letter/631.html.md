<h2> Translated letter:</h2>The like of Amfrey de Feringes to keep the countries of Oxford and Berks, rendering at the Exchequer as much as William de Mucheldovere used to render.
Mandate to the said William to deliver the same to him.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position. ("The like" refers to previous entries on the same page of the Patent Rolls: "Appointment, during pleasure, of Ralph de Arden to keep the counties of Essex and Hertford, rendering at the Exchequer as much as Henry de Helgheton used to render. Mandate to the tenants of the honours of Boulogne, Haghenet and Peverel of London, and of the barony of Redlegh to be intendant to him." Several other like mandates directly precede that to Amfrey.)
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
