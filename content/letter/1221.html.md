<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>Donation of countess Adelaide and of countess Agnes, widow of the marquis Peter, her daughter-in-law, to the canonries of St. Mary of Susa and of St. Lawrence of Oulx, of tithes of Susa, tithes and churches of Sille, Mattie, Bussolino and other lands. There is a slightly different version of this charter in Muletti, <em>Memorie ... di Saluzzo</em>,&nbsp; from which I have noted the main differences as footnotes to the <em>Historia</em> text and translation (JF).</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>* A church constructed in the village that is called Chaumont, dedicated in honor of the blessed Mary ever Virgin, with all the endowment and offering and tithe pertaining to it and a piece of vineyard with its land set in the Urbiano area, which was formerly a field, and every toll from all the things of that canonry which cross through the close of Susa; whence that lady countess Adelaide had previously made a gift of investiture to said canonry, also all things which that lord Nantelm, provost and other canons of that church legally acquired in all her lands; "ecclesiam unam constructam in vico, ubi dicitur Caput montis, in honore beatae Mariae semper Virginis dedicatam cum omni dote et offertione atque decima ad ipsam pertinentibus et petiam unam de vinea cum area sua posita in fundo Urbiano, quae olim brayda fuit, atque omne toloneum de rebus omnibus universis istae canonicae, quae per clusam Secusiae transierint; unde ipsa domna Adalegida comitissa iam antea investiturae donum praedictae canonicae fecerat, etiam et omnes res, quas ipse domnus Nantelmus praepositus caeterique ipsius ecclesiae canonici in omni terra ipsarum legaliter adquisierunt"
