<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Many are my sins before God, but what have I done against my lady that I should be rejected from her service?  I have never violated my promised faith, never put off what was committed to me.  I thought that I acted in piety without avarice.  If I erred a little from your will, it was by improvidence not deliberate intent.  Let your continued fasts suffice in penance for you, as I am sure they do.  The blind cupidity of certain poor nobles prevailed for a time.  Now let your piety, which always favored justice, prevail.  May the divinity favor the kingdom in this, couseling you and subjecting royal powers to your empire.  My judgment is this:  the faith I have kept to your lord son I shall keep to my lady his mother, if I can not in person then absent, speaking well of her, desiring her good, praying her good.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Multa quidem peccata mea ante Deum, sed contra dominam meam que, ut a servitio eius repellar?  Fidem promissam numquam violavi, commissa non prodidi. Pietatem sine avaritia exercere me putavi. Si erravi circa voluntatem vestram modicum quid, fecit hoc inprovidentia, non deliberatio. Sintque vobis continuate satis iam in penitentia quadragesime, quod certe sic confido esse. Prevaluit ad tempus quorundam nobilium pauperum ceca cupiditas. Nunc praevaleat vestra, que semper fuit, circa iusticiam pietas. Favet ad hoc divinitas regna vobis concilians et reges potentes vestro imperio subdens. Mea sententia hec est: quam fidem filio domine mee A. servavi, eam matri servabo, si nequeo praesens, saltim absens bene loquendo, bene optando, bene orando.
