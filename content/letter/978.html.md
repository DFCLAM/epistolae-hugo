<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[Again]
I directed this sign to you for the highest gift,
that one cross might cover two brothers/siblings equally;
in alternate times, let this govern our breasts
and love share a common good.
When it comes to you, this will remain more with me;
it does me more good when it holds your heart.
May the beauty of it be always within your innards,
then Christ will have perpetual wealth there.
In the consecrated cross, who hangs it in piety,
when it hangs with you, he offers his hand.
I greet our common venerable mother with my voice,
may she remain long associated with you.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>[Item aliud]
Hoc tibi pro summo direxi munere signum,
ut pariter fratres crux tegat una duos;
alternis vicibus haec pectora nostra gubernet
et commune bonum participetur amor.
ad te quando venit, mecum magis ista manebit;
plus mihi proficiet, cum tua corda tenet.
sit huius species intra tua viscera semper,
tunc ibi perpetuam Christus habebit opem.
in cruce sacrata qui tunc pietate pependit,
haec tibi cum pendet, porrigit ille manum.
commune matrem venerando voce saluto,
quae maneat vobis consociata diu.
