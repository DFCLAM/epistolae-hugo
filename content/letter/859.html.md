<h2> Translated letter:</h2>We, Cunegund, queen of the Bohemians by the grace of God, make known to all who see the present writing that over the controversy which occurred between the master and brothers of St. Mary at the foot of the bridge of the Prague hospital of St. John the Baptist on the one hand and the master and brothers of the hospital of St. Francis on the street of the Teutonics of Prague on the other over the town of Vysehnevice, which the former wife of Muttine, Bohuslava of good memory had conferred on the house of St. Mary at the foot of the bridge, an amicable settlement was mediated, namely that said master and brothers of St. Mary should collect, without any distress or disturbance, from the proceeds pertaining to the mentioned master and brothers of the hospital of St. Francis of the Holy Cross in Wirben, eighty marks in Prague weight, and they, the master and brothers of St. Mary, renounced before us by every action or right whatever was appropriate to them from the expenses thence incurred against the master and brothers of St. Francis over the mentioned goods.  Therefore with both sides summoned we have given the present letters in witness of that settlement approved by those having and requiring our consent and favor for it, fortified by the force of our seal.
Enacted in this year of the lordâ€™s incarnation 1247, dated by the hand of our notary Frederick, schoolman of Vysehrad.
