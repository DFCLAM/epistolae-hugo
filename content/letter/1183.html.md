<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Adelaide [Aelis] who was the wife of lord John of Avennes, defender of Holland and of Zeeland, to the castellan of Ath and all his sergeants, greetings.
We order and command you and wish that without fail you do not take from the gentlemen and handmaids of Notre Dame de Condet mortmain, the best [thousandth?] possession, or douzaine; and if you have taken them, that you give them back entirely, for as we have seen in the letters of my lord baron who has died and in the letters of my lady his mother the countess, they are quit of them and do not owe any of these things; and do this so that it does not come back to us again.
This was done in the year of the incarnation of our Lord 1260, the day of the Epiphany.
