<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To the most excellent lady Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary, the convent of the monastery of St. Giles of Somogy [sends] fitting and devoted prayers in the Lord.&nbsp; We received the letters of your excellence in these words:&nbsp; Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to her faithful, the abbot and convent of Somogy greetings and grace.&nbsp; Luke, son of Bágyon, our youth, who announced to us the joy on the part of our lord king over the conflict with the Cumans and the victory obtained against them, asked to be given by us a certain land of our heralds/criers, called Atád, in the county of Somogy, saying:&nbsp; there are six dwellings in it; whence we order your loyalty commanding that you send one of you in whose witness Andrew the tavarnok/<i>tárnok </i>will walk said land, with those who share boundaries present, and you will write back to us faithfully in your letters the assigned limits and names of those summoned and number of dwellings sitting on said land.&nbsp; Dated near Buda, on the day after St. Nicholas the Confessor.&nbsp; We, however, wishing to satisfy your orders as we ought and are held to, sent one priest from us with your said man Andrew as witness, who afterwards having come back to us together with that man of yours, Andrew, said&nbsp; that in his presence with neighbors and boundary-sharers he walked said land Atád of your heralds/criers through the old and ancient boundaries, and found that more than six dwellings sat in that land Atád, and with those heralds/criers not objecting he established it for master Luke, your youth in that condition in which those heralds/criers were known to have possessed it from of old, with all its uses and appurtenances.&nbsp; Indeed the nobles from the other village Atád on his land which they had mixed with the lands of your heralds/criers, similarly also the noble lady, widow of count John, son of Pouche, made objections over a certain piece of that land; but master Luke, your youth and Andrew, your man, relinquished the rights of said nobles of Atád and said noble lady to be possessed peacefully by them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Excellentissimae Dominae suae Elisabethae, Dei gratia, Regina Hungariae, conuentus monasterii S.
