<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the father and son and holy spirit amen.&nbsp; It is fitting that favorable things be confirmed and protected by documents and witnesses with the report and evidence of the actions [taken], lest they be obscured by dispute or a cloud of oblivion.&nbsp; Since therefore the assembly of men, which is natural and, it is said, brings justice on earth, as justice is favorable to all, and that assembly equally.&nbsp; Intending therefore to locate a city in Kraków and to bring together there men from different regions, we press on the ears of individuals in the present as well as the future, that we, Boleslaw, by the grace of god duke of Kraków and Sandomierz, together with our illustrious mother Gremislava, and our noble spouse Cunegunde, by that right we locate it where the city of Wratizlava (Wrocław) was located, as it is not there.&nbsp; But what ought to be the form of the city according to the law of Magdeburg is noted so that if there should be a doubt about it, there may be recourse for the doubters to the written law.&nbsp; First, therefore, we wish this to be firmly observed, we promised, with our advocates Gedcon called Stilvoyt, Jacob formerly judge of Nyza and Dethmar called Wolk in our presence personally, that we would inviolably observe that all citizens living in that city would for six years have no payment or any charge from us that they must make for their persons or places, or pertaining to that city, unless for the rooms where cloths are sold, and the rooms of peddlers, called <i>Cram </i>in the vernacular from which after we have built them at our expense and labor five parts of the payments for those would come to us,&nbsp; indeed the said advocates take the sixth part by heredity; this however is not by right, but by our special grace. Indeed after the six years have gone by, in whatever area they will be held to pay us half the share of weight of Theutonic silver&nbsp; as will then be the usual payment.&nbsp; We confer the right and free power over stalls of butchers, bakers, and cobblers (calcipariorum) on said advocates to be retained perpetually or confered on others at their pleasure so that the possessors of said stalls may be absolved from all charge in perpetuity.&nbsp;<br>The advocates, when the freedom in that city is finished, will obtain the sixth court from all perpetually and freely, not by right but from our special grace.&nbsp; Similarly another court outside the city, where sheep will be slaughtered, they will possess freely and by hereditary right.&nbsp; We also&nbsp; grant and promise to observe inviolably that the oft-mentioned advocates may convey their wares perpetually without any charge or toll of ours and cross through our entire dominion and duchy.&nbsp; Other inhabitants of that city will enjoy that freedom for ten years.&nbsp; We promise also to those advocates and all the citizens that we will not appoint an advocate for them, neither special nor general, but when any business should arise that requires greater investigation, either we will participate or send someone from our side to complete the business.&nbsp; We wish also and grant to said city that for ploughing and pasturing and other uses they may have by hereditary right the town which is commonly called <i>Rybitwy,</i> with all the appurtenances of that town except the channels; also with the whole territory which is between the city and the river <i>Prudnyk</i> in a ring from said town <i>Rybitwy</i> to the town called <i>Crowodra (Krowodrza)</i>, so that that town <i>Crowordra</i> is included with its appurtenances, except for episcopal right to the lands and mills of said river.&nbsp; In that river, we also grant to the advocates&nbsp; or to whomever they name our two mills and a third that was formerly [held by] the brothers/friars of Mechowia, also a fourth, that was of the monks of <i>Andreow;</i> and if they can build several mills in that river without harm or prejudice to the others we grant that power by hereditary right so that they are held to pay us annually the ferton [German coin] of usual silver for whatever wheel in the present or future.&nbsp; We also confirm the use of the river Wysle with each shore from the boundaries of <i>Swerincia</i> to the boundaries of the cloister of <i>Mogyla</i> city so that it may be freely fished and the oft-[mentioned advocates] may construct three mills, and possess them free of any payment by hereditary right, except that they be held to grind the grain for our storerooms in that city or near it, especially for the consumption of three thousand.&nbsp; If in the space of said river they wished to build more mills, it is permitted with the will and consent of the advocates, so only that they be held to pay us half a Mark of the usual silver annually from whatever wheel.&nbsp;</p><p>We also add in perpetuity to all the uses of that city the whole Wood in the upper part of <i>Wisla</i> which is called <i>Chwacymech</i> in the vernacular.&nbsp; We also confer on said advocates the possession of thirty franconish (franconicos) dwellings, free from all payment and service and every ducal law and charge by hereditary right.&nbsp; And since it is legal/right that an actor follows the jurisdiction of the thing, we order and wish that when it happens that there is a complaint against a citizen of said city by a Pole of the diocese of Kraków, his case should be brought before a Polish judge; and conversely if a Pole bring a case against a citizen, the advocates should make the judgment and stop the dispute.&nbsp; This also those advocates promised us that they would make no one bound to us &nbsp;or the church or anyone else or a free Pole who up to now lived in the country-side a citizen, lest on our account they devastate the rural estates of bishops or canons or others.&nbsp; This also we grant to the advocates and all the inhabitants of that city present and future and their heirs in perpetuity that after the freedom is ended not one of them may go or send anyone to fighting or to resisting outside the duchy of Kraków according to the boundaries of that duchy which we now possess or shall possess afterwards with god giving.&nbsp; We wish also and declare this added condition to the city that whatever moneyers there were, should pay the lord Prandota, bishop of Kraków and his successors in the perpetual name of the church of Kraków without any difficulty and as requested by us fully and without diminution a tenth of the money so that if anyone should impede or delay this payment, the bishop may coerce him with ecclesiastical censure, according to the terms of the nine parts to be paid by us or our successors.&nbsp;</p><p>We promised, granted, and gave each and every one of these things to the advocates and their heirs in perpetuity.&nbsp; Again to the citizens and city and their successors these are to be observed inviolably by us and our successors.&nbsp; No one at all is permitted to breach this page of our grant, donation, and promise, or to oppose it by any bold daring.&nbsp; If anyone should presume to attempt this, he should know he will incur the indignation of almighty god and the holy martyrs Stanislaus and Wenceslaus and of us.&nbsp; In order that all these may obtain perpetual force, we have had appended to the presents our seal and that of the venerable father, already named P[randota] by the grace of God bishop of Kraków and the chapter of that church, and our barons count Adam castellan, as well as count Nicholas palatine of Kraków.&nbsp; These were enacted in a meeting near the town which is called <i>Coporina</i> in the vernacular, in the 1257th year from the incarnation of the lord, on the nones of June.&nbsp; Present:&nbsp; our venerable father in Christ the oftmentioned P[randota], bishop of Kraków and the aforesaid count Adam, castellan of Kraków, Fulco, our chancellor, said count Nicholas palatine of Kraków, count John, judge of Sandomierz, count Nicholas judge of Kraków, count Warso, butler of Sandomierz, Lassota, provost of Skarbimierz, Twardozlas, subchancellor of our court.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>In nomine patris et filij et spiritus sanctij amen.&nbsp;
