<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Philip, by grace of God king of the Franks, to his beloved and faithful Blanche, countess palatine of Troyes, greetings and love.&nbsp; About what you reported to us about building a wall in the castle of Provins, we report to you that it pleases us well and we wish that you make the wall where it is missing in said castle to the order and measure of the wall that remains, and you have it done without little towers, since it is not fitting that you fear that Erard will lay seige to you.&nbsp; Enacted at Melun, in the year of the Lord 1216, in the month of April.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Philippus Dei gratia Francorum rex, dilecte et fideli sue B(lanche) comitisse Trecensis palatine salutem et dilectionem. Super eo quod nobis mandavistis de muro faciendo in castello Pruvinensi, vobis mandamus, quod nobis bene placet et bene volumus, ut murum ubi deest in dicto castello faciatis ad ordinem et mensuram illius muri qui superest, et hoc sine tornellis fieri faciatis quia non oportet vos timere quod Erardus vos obsideat. Actum Meledunum, anno Domini M CC XVI, mense aprili.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The king permits the countess to fortify her walls at Provins against Erard of Brienne.&nbsp; A truce was made between them in July.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>The Cartulary of Countess Blanche of Champagne</i>, edited by Theodore Evergates, Â© The Medieval Academy of America 2010 (University of Toronto Press, 2009), 258, #287.&nbsp; Reprinted with permission of the press.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1216, April
