<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Again to the same queen, greetings.
We send to our lord and relative Louis, king of France, your son, the aforementioned envoys, to whom we have given power to treat a firm and just truce between that king your son and us, to be fixed and maintained; and to fix and maintain it between him and us.  And we have made this known to you.
Witnessed as above.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Item eidem regine, salutem.  Mittimus ad dominum et consanguieum nostrum L. regem etc. quibus potestatem dedimus ad tractandum de firma et recta treuga inter ipsum regem filium vestrum et nos capienda et tenenda, et ad ipsam treugam inter ipsum et nos capiendam.  Et hoc vobis significamus.
Teste ut supra.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The same letter, announcing that the envoys he is sending have the power to negotiate and fix a truce between them, was sent to Louis, except for the last sentence which is only to Blanche:  “and we have made this known to you.”
This letters follows another to Blanche in both sources.
