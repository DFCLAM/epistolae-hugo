<h2> Translated letter:</h2>This letter to you, revered Marcella, and to you, my daughter Principia, I have dictated in the wakeful hours of one short night. I have used no charms of eloquence; my one wish has been to show my gratitude to you both, my one desire to please both God and my readers.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Haec tibi, Marcella venerabilis, et haec tibi, Principia filia, una et brevi lucubratione dictavi non eloquii venustate sed voluntate gratissimi in vos animi et Deo et legentibus placere desiderans.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>Jerome wrote this letter in praise and memory of Marcella after her death for Principia. But the ending, which is addressed to both Principia and Marcella reveals how much he is also still talking to his old friend. Only the ending is cited here; for the rest of the letter see Principia.
