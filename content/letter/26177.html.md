<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the holy trinity and individual unity, Bela, by the grace of God king of Hungary, Dalmatia, and Rama in perpetuity.&nbsp; Since the slightest trace of a question rarely or never arises or emerges when the title of possession is commended to the memory of posterity by the advantage of an authentic document, from the office&nbsp; of royal highness, adhering to the limits of justice, urged by pious devotion which we have and bear to the house of the Hospital of Jerusalem, we have held it worthy to [say] how the church of St. Stephen of Alba was transferred to the said house of the Hospital from the beginnings of its origin.&nbsp; Martrius, a man of exceptional honor, archbishop of the church of Strigo, laid the first stones in said church and brought it almost to halfway; but prevented by death, he could not finish it.&nbsp; Finally, our lady mother, enflamed by the impulse of divine inspiration, for the remedy of her soul and the soul of her husband, our father, king Geza of pious memory, and for our salvation, finished said monastery with the desired work, and conferred on it to possess perpetually richly endowed and enriched with various possessions for the religion and honor of that house of the Hospital.&nbsp; These are the names of the estates which were conferred on the said monastery by our lady mother:&nbsp; Vynduar, Chergon, Zaloc, Bodan, Acachy, Koresky, Igor, Chiz, Meger, Gau, Hun, Berhin, Sumbehen, Mariada, Feyreghaza, Chepel, Liba, Horcha, Gauth, Worosth, Fada, Vilak, Teuel, Felik, Dus, Petrella, Barz, Izka, Zoboka, Tymar, Chepzy, Horca, Zold, Ianata, Bonica, Concol, Varug, Bodayth, Esceu, Sag, Agar, Boglar, Hodog, Hug, Goloz, Guden, Ulcan, Toploza, Copuil, Aremnes, Ker, Fuimes, Szegved, Halaz, Bivol.&nbsp; In Vyudyar the land is marked on every side by boundaries.&nbsp; The first boundary begins from the water which is called Clesna, on the side of the sea, and goes to the meadow where the boundary becomes earthen, and so it enters into the wood and goes up to Raquatiqueret.&nbsp; From there to another water, which is called Libonza, and thence to a small mountain; from the small mountain to the firs, thence to the tree set beside the road; there the land is divided with count Giles; from said tree, it extends from said tree to another tree, thence to the old pit; there it enters the road, and next to the road the boundary goes to a boundary as far as the wood which is called Bekon, and beyond Bekon it goes to two elms and there is divided with Johan, son of count Andrew; from there the boundary goes to the water which is called Benenka, there is divided with Bakon; from said water it reaches to two poplars, and thence to another water which is called Clesna, there is divided with Buzad; thence to a certain tree surrounded by a ditch.&nbsp; From there the boundary goes&nbsp; to the great road, thence to an earthen boundary, there is divided with Micus; thence the boundary goes to a little mountain and there is shared with jobagiones [castle warriors] of Bocouniz; from there it enters the road and goes from pear to pear as far as Cerufa; there it is divided with the poplars of count Ceche.&nbsp; From there to the small mountain and there is shared with Wayda.&nbsp; From there to the great road, and there is an earthen boundary, where it is shared with Pomlim and thus the boundary is completed up to said water, which is called Cleona.&nbsp; Beside the sea in Chergon it first begins from the fishery Abram, and goes as far as the small mountain Aremquelem, thence to the water Lizem, where it is divided with Anthony, and next to that water it extends to Vertes, there is divided with Peter; thence to another water Zordne, and there a tree is the division for four parts, signed for the boundary and beside that water it rises higher to an earthen boundary and there is divided with Both; from there it descends to the oak from the oak to Egerus, and there is a bikfa** as boundary, thence to a pear; there it enters the road, where it is divided with the abbot of St. Jacob, thence to the fishery Tureg, thence to the gate Sorcod, thence to Gudejecara, thence to Egris, thence to the port Libanz, thence to the water Vitmiz where it is divided with Cuna; thence to another water Sidala, thence to Cangelis, thence to the pear, thence to the small mountain and there is an earthen boundary; thence to Biusquereg, and there is shared with count Martin, son of Myrtur, thence to the mountain Papa, thence to the water Vegag; there is it shared with our sands.&nbsp; In Zulue, the first boundary begins from the water Riganz; there is it shared with Benedic, thence to the port; there it is shared with the son of count Thomas, thence to the water Inota, there it crosses to the oak, and beside that water it reaches to another water Galanas, where it is shared with Vinceslov, and enters the road Baboura, and goes to the water Zudurig, where it is shared with our servants.&nbsp; Thence from boundary to boundary, and it is divided with Paul.&nbsp; Thence to the town Guguleg, thence to Cutules, thence to the town Bissenorum; there it is shared with Mouc, son of count Stephen, and so it goes back to the town mentioned above and is shared with Johan, son of count Turde.&nbsp; In Narasd the first boundary begins from Humeron and goes to the pear, thence to another pear, where it is shared with the estates of Corach, thence through boundaries and is shared with the son of Farcasi, thence to three pears where it enters the road and it cuts off a tree surrounded by a ditch, thence to two trees where it is&nbsp; shared with count Thomas and his brother Grisogono; there it enters the road and goes to a great earthen boundary.&nbsp; In Horch the first boundary begins from the water Fyzeg, thence to a broad field from boundary to boundary and so it goes to said water Fuzeg.&nbsp; In Bodochg the first boundary begins from Cutfew, thence to Hyciugni, thence to Quiescut, thence to Feldeswar, thence to Ruesare, thence to Monz, thence to Solovult, thence to Leansevum, thence to the town Berith.&nbsp;

In Timar, Quescut begins the first boundary, then to Gueshyg, thence to the Sunnig road, thence to Falenzeg, thence to the perforated stone, thence to the valley, thence to the stony ditch,* thence to the Red Road, and then returns to the mentioned pit.*&nbsp; In Barz, the first boundary begins from the estate of Peter and reaches the embankment,* thence to Keuresbocor, thence to Alsocut, thence to the pit/embankment of Sacerdos (the priest), thence to the mill, thence to Monachum (the Monk), thence to Borsod, thence to the Arpad valley, thence to Gyren, where it enters the Almas road and goes to Pyrum, thence to the perforated tree, thence to the embankment of Peter, thence to Loocol, thence to Ker, thence to Zamor, thence to the long embankment, where it enters the road and goes to the other embankment, thence to the Strigo road, thence to the ditch/embankment of the Fox, and so&nbsp;

it crosses over to Aigiskew, thence descends from boundary to boundary up to the said water Sar.&nbsp; In Godan, the land is three ploughlands, in Acachin, eight; and the wood in three places, first from the east, second from the west, which the great road divides, on the right it is the monastery’s, on the left Richard’s, so from boundary to boundary up to the fir, thence to one tree, thence to one pit, and so proceeds to the third wood, thence to the great road and by that road to the church of St. Mary.&nbsp; In Igor, the land goes to two ploughlands, in Varang to two, in Copiul to two, in Feyreghaz to one, in Chepel to one, in Petrella to two, in Agar next to Forten to five; and in Forten the said brothers have a part as do our servants.&nbsp;

in Hodog the land goes to one ploughland, in Heeg to one, in Bivol to five; and there is an island beside the Danube, whose boundary begins from one embankment and goes to the port, and there is an earthen boundary.&nbsp; In the town of Stegved, the first boundary begins from the Hynogh pit and goes to the Huou mountain, thence to the Sodolche embankment, thence to Kac, thence to the tree of John, thence to Feuholm, and so returns to the said pit.&nbsp;

and a half part of water and meadow belongs to said monatery, the other half to the right of the abbot of St. Demetrius, and next to that water reaches to the head of the great swamp, thence to Rammaiyg, and so returns to said road.&nbsp; In the town of Bonica, there are three vineyards, of which Borongh gave the largest one.&nbsp; In Toploza the land is ten ploughshares, in Furmes six; in Scetqued, the land is signed by boundaries in one place with three blocks of wood, and it goes to the port, and is with the monastery at that port.&nbsp; In Goboz the land is two ploughlands, in Halaz three; and there is a wood next to the Danube whose boundary is dug under.&nbsp; Toploza begins and goes to the head of the fishery, which is called Narag, and is completed by its bounds at the wood of St. Benedict, which is called Culpen, and there are eight fisheries there, whose names are:&nbsp; Huzetony, Ceraka, Taynad, Tarinew, Csompa, Quinostow, Gorimbuka, Narag.&nbsp;<br>Those estates, whose limits are noted in the present page, by our said Demetrius, son of Gabriel, with witnesses from the provinces added to it, with every exception for the magnates we have had the boundaries surrounded and raised; and equally the limits which are not noted we have had looked at by that same Demetrius and the names noted.&nbsp; There is no man who has brought to the ears of our highness anything contrary against the said men of the Hospital.&nbsp; Wherefore we have defended this by the protection of the present page to the donation, so it cannot be contradicted in the future by any bold daring.&nbsp; Moreover we, wishing to add something to the heavenly treasury, for the care of the poor, to whom the said house daily administers necessities, we have given free [not taxable?] money from Quuduor and Thergon, which pertain to royal right up to sixty marks in perpetuity.&nbsp; If indeed from these places, with God disposing, it should grow so that the free moneys exceed the sum of sixty marks, we leave the excess to the will of the kings who will succeed us.&nbsp; This charter is given by the hand of master Katopanus, provost of Alba, chancellor of the royal court, in the thousand hundred ninety third year from the incarnation of the Lord, with the venerable Job, archbishop of Strigo present;
