<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all who will look at the present writing, that William of Mont-Saint-Jean confessed in our presence that he approved and ordered his men of Vergy to do the will and order of the lord abbot of Citeaux in every way in the controversy that existed between the Cistercian house on one side and said men on the other; and the agreement that was made over usage of the groves is firm and we have had our seal appended at his will and order.  Enacted in the 1219th year of the Lord in the month of April.
