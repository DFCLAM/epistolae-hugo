<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To the distinguished queen,

Mere au roi Edward la senée,

li soiez levé et recordée.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>John of Hoveden describes himself at the beginning of his "Rossignos," a French version of his Latin "Philomena," as "clerc la roine d'Engleterre, mere le roi Edward," a clerk of the queen of England, mother of king Edward. The poem is about the life and death and ascension of Christ, and the assumption of Mary. The French version was done for the queen, as the concluding lines cited here indicate.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><em>Poems of John of Hoveden</em>, ed. F.J.E.
