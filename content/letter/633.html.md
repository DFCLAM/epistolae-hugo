<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Notification to the bailiffs and wardens of the fair of Boston that the king is sending Robert de Dacre, taker of wines, to the said fair to take 100 tuns of wine to the king’s use.
By the queen.
And he has letters patent thereof.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
