<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the holy and individual trinity.&nbsp; In the 1072nd year from the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ, 14th kalends of February, 10th indiction.&nbsp; In the monastery of the church of St. Andrew the apostle, which was built in the suburb of the city of Mantova where the lord Albert is known to preside as abbot.&nbsp; We, Beatrice, daughter of the late Frederick, and Matilda, daughter of the late Boniface, mother and daughter, countesses and duchesses, who are committed to live under Salic law,&nbsp; as presenters and donors to that monastery, have said in person to those present:&nbsp; Whoever would confer something of his possessions on holy and venerable places, according to the voice of authority [Mark 10:30, Math 19:29] will receive a hundredfold in this world, and moreover what is still better, will possess eternal life.&nbsp; Therefore we, the named Beatrice and Matilda, give and offer from the present day to that monastery for our souls and the reward of the late Boniface, my (the named Matilda) father, to that order which is inscribed below, namely one court of a farm, [domuscoltilis], which is called Fornigada, with a chapel consecrated in honor of St. George, martyr of Christ, with houses and all things in those lands and possessions [masaritiis] and thickets and woods, which are known to pertain to that court and chapel in our jurisdiction, which we are known to have in the county of Mantova.&nbsp; And the said court with said chapel and possessions which pertain to that court and chapel, together with the whole settlement and the vines and arable lands and meadows and grasslands by just measure thirty-two jugers* and of woods with their untilled lands three thousand jugers.&nbsp; And if anything further of things in our jurisdiction should be found pertaining to that court and chapel and wood, which is bound by the above measure, by this charter of offering it would remain in the power of that monastery by proprietary right, as was said, so much as said court and chapel and wood, with its pertaining settlements and vineyards, with their untilled and arable lands, and grasslands and meadows, pastures, woods, and stands, riverbanks, rocks, marshes, fisheries, cultivated and uncultivated, divided and undivided, together with all the boundaries and borders, accesses to waters and water conduits, with all rights, what is adjacent and pertaining of those things by place and name to that court and chapel and the wood pertaining in its entirety.&nbsp; And belonging to said court:&nbsp; to the east the land of St. Peter in the above city of Mantova and of St. Rufinus, in the south, the river which is called Lario, to the west the monastery and land of St. Peter, similarly a canal [fossa] from the mountains, which is called Fornigada, and that river which is called Mincio and is a lake.&nbsp;&nbsp; As much the aforesaid court of the farm with its said chapel and all things pertaining to it of our said jurisdiction, together with accesses and entries and its higher and lower [parts], as is read above, in its entirety from this day we gave to that monastery, confer, and by the present charter of offering confirm it to hold there.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, by knife, knotted straw, glove, and clod of land and branch of a tree, we give over and invest legally on the part of that monastery and we henceforth abandon and make ourselves alien and absent and leave it to be held as the property of that monastery, letting it do on the part of that monastery whatever it will by proprietary name, by that order as is read above, without any opposition or reclamation from us, the above mother and daughter, and our heirs and their heirs.&nbsp; Indeed, we put forth and promise that the above mother and daughter together with our heirs and their heirs will defend the afore-written offering on the part of that monastery, as read above, in its entirety against anyone opposing it.&nbsp; Which if we could not defend it or sought to remove anything thence from you, then we would restore doubly that offering as read above in its entirety on the part of that monastery, as it might have increased in value by estimate in a similar place, according to that order that the above-mentioned abbot or his successors and the bishop, who is now known to preside over the bishopric of the church of Mantova, or their successors not have authority or power by any trick or circumstance that might occur to sell, give, exchange or alienate by title of emphyteusis** and by deed or benefice or any other way unless by deed to minor persons in order to make payment for use and consumption or to the family of that monastery and the abbot and monks who are now there or will afterwards be ordained in that monastery. &nbsp;And if anything were done against this, the above-written things would come back to the power of the above mother and daughter or their heirs and the heirs’ heirs until all these return to the above-written use.&nbsp; Moreover we reserve to ourselves the usufruct and lordship of that wood as long as we, together or separately, live, except that the abovesaid abbot or his successors have use of it and the pasturing of their and their serfs’ pigs.&nbsp; If, indeed, anyone, which I do not believe will happen, if we the above Beatrice and Matilda, mother and daughter, let it not be so, or any of our heirs or their heirs or whatever opposing person should ever attempt to fight this charter of offering or break it by any kind of trick, then we would incur on that part, against which we brought suit, a fine, which is the penalty of fifty ounces of the best gold &nbsp;and eighty weights of silver.&nbsp; And we would not be able to claim what we sought, but this present charter of offering would remain firm for all time and would persist&nbsp; undisturbed with the supporting stipulation.&nbsp; And we have raised the parchment with ink from the earth; this charter of my offering page I gave over to judge John of the holy palace and asked him to write confirming which he offered it here below to be strengthened by witnesses.<br>Enacted in the abovewritten city, Mantova, happily.<br>Signs of the hands of Algiso and Razo and Crescentius, witnesses living under Salic law.<br>Signs of the hands of Roger of the city of Reggio and Paganus of Corsena and Ingo and Beatus of Fornigada, witnesses.<br>I who am the above palatine judge John, scribe of this charter of offering, completed and gave it as committed to me.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p class="m5073920867656644882gmail-msobodytext">In nomine sancte et individue trinitatis.&nbsp;
