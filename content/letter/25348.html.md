<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I, M[arguerite], countess and marchioness in Italy, to all our barons, provosts/officials, and bailiffs to whom these letters will come, greetings and all good. Since whatever we have of dignity, rank, and power we believe and confess was conferred on us by the grace of divine mercy, it is worthy that we be zealous to defend all who wish to live piously in Christ and particularly those who are within our dominion, from all harm against all men for our salvation and that of our people; whence, since we particularly love the house and brothers of Arvières of the Carthusian order and we put faith in the lord from their love, we take their things and sheep and household and friends and those coming to them and going back into the duchy, under our protection, commanding you and ordering by command that none of you harm them; but rather each protect and defend them from all injury and vexation, and restore without delay any of their things that were violently taken for no reason, and we wish this to be firmly observed by all of you so that you may be worthy to receive eternal mercy from the lord and our love and grace.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego M.
