<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and future who will look at the present writing greetings in the bestower of salvation of all.&nbsp; Right persuades and the order of reason demands that the grace of reginal benevolence defend and confirm by the patronage of her charters the possessions of the faithful held and obtained legally.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all of you by the content of the presents that favorably inclined to the just requests of Gregory Otrochk, son of Beluch and the sons of Sewa holding lands of Pozsega, we left to them the land called &nbsp;Oryoycha in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Pozsega which they held by right at the time of lady Maria our mother-in-law of pious memory according to the content of the charter of that lady Maria, to be possessed in perpetuity with its uses and appurtenances.&nbsp; The boundaries of that land as we saw it contained in letters patent of Lawrence formerly count/<i>ispán</i> of Pozsega are defined in this way:&nbsp; the first boundary begins from the west near the Oryoycha river and there is a land boundary, thence it climbs to the mountain to three oak (<i>tulfa)</i> trees beneath which is a land boundary and there is a shared boundary with Mylsa, where it goes east and reaches a road and goes through that road southward to three <i>tulfa</i> trees under which is a land boundary, thence indeed it goes through a rise (<i>byrch)</i> and reaches a <i>cherfa</i> under which is a land boundary; there are shared boundaries with the lady queen’s people of Komiricha to the east, thence it goes to a pear under which is a land boundary, then to a land boundary and there are shared boundaries with the lady queen’s people of Grad creek, thence to a land boundary which land boundary divides the land of Beluch from the land of the lady queen, there a shared boundary with said Beluch and Peter son of Cheley, thence it goes to a land boundary which is next to a vineyard of the lady queen’s people, thence above the vineyard it reaches a land boundary, thence rises to a pear tree under which is a land boundary, thence it goes to a willow tree which is in the middle of the village under which is a land boundary, thence it goes to a land boundary which is behind the courtyard of Peter, son of Chelley, thence to a land boundary which is beside a valley and goes through that valley higher to a land boundary which is beside said valley, then rises higher to the west to the church of St. Luke the evangelist and under the churchyard is a land boundary, thence it rises northward and reaches a pear tree under which is a land boundary and there are shared boundaries with the lady queen’s people of Oryoycha, thence again to a pear tree under which is a land boundary, from which it goes to a fruit-tree (<i>gymulchynfa) </i>under which is a land boundary, thence to a pear tree under which is a land boundary, there are shared boundaries of Otrochk and the Sewa brothers, thence it turns eastward and descends to a valley to a land boundary, then rises to the mountain and reaches a hornbeam (<i>gyrteanfa)</i> tree under which is a land boundary, thence to a <i>tulfa </i>tree under which is a land boundary, thence it descends to a well/trench which is as a boundary and through the water of said &nbsp;well/trench it falls into the Oryoycha river and there next to the Oryoycha river is a land boundary and through said Oryoycha water it goes against the course of the water and reaches a prior boundary and there the boundaries of the land called Oryoycha of oft-mentioned Beluch, end; also the &nbsp;fishpool called Chernuch pertaining to said land Oryoycha, as they say, we leave to them without injustice of an alien right to be possessed in the aforesaid way.&nbsp; In memory and perpetual stability of which thing we have granted the present letters to said Gregory Otrochk and son Sewa enforced by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of master Gregory faithful chancellor of our court, in the thousand two hundred seventy fifth year from the incarnation of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elysabeth dei gracia regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam futuris presens scriptum inspecturis salutem in salutis omnium largitore.&nbsp;
