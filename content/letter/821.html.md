<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I Marie, countess of Troyes, make known to present and future that, since my dearest son count Henry conferred a certain part of the vineyard which belonged to Gerard, brother of Milo of Bray, with the assent of that Gerard on the church of Saint-Jean-en-Chastel, situated at the head of that church, having a width of 80 feet and a length from the end of the city wall to the road which leads from St. Quentin to the city.  The venerable man, Thibaut, abbot of the Monti√©ramey (Arremarensis) monastery soon after bought that part of the vineyard converted to flat land and another small piece of land, from the private chambers up to the hardening Seine, from the children of said Gerard, namely Garner, Hugo, Milo, Emelina, their mother praising and granting, and gave 21 pounds from the benefice of the church of St. John to those children.  Said children praised this sale and praised it again when they came to the age of discretion, and will have their heirs do the same, and they appointed as pledges Gaufrid of Maissiac, Garner of Maissiac, and Salo of Corgens, and Garner of Villa Meruel.
Which, ordered in my presence, that it may be held valid and remain known, I have confirmed with the testimony of my seal, annotated with letters.
Enacted in the year of the incarnation of the Word 1194, in the month of July.
Dated by the hand of Walter, chancellor.

Vendagium autem istud dicti pueri laudaverunt, et iterum laudabunt quando ad annos discretionis pervenerint, et id ipsum ab universis heredibus suis laudari facient, et inde constituerunt plegios Gaufridum de Maissiaco, Garnerum de Maissiaco, et Salonem de Corgeseniis, et Garnerum de Villa Meruel.
Quod, in presentia mea ordinatum, ut ratum teneatur et notum permaneat, litteris annotatum sigilli mei testimonio confirmavi.
