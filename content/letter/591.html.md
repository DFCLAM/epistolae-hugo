<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Appointment of John Lestrange and Robert de Grendon to view the injury done to the king by Griffin de Brumfeud and his men in respect of certain woods belonging to the king’s manor of Ellesmere and to amend the said injury according to law and the custom of the realm and they are to signify what they do to the queen and R. earl of Cornwall under their seals.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
