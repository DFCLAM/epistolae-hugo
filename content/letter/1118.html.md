<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I Joan, countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, make known to all who will view the present letters that my beloved and faithful Giles of Saint Albert and Margaret, his wife, with my consent have given as alms freely and completely to the church of Vorst a tithe, which they held in fealty from me, which they had in the parish of Borsta and Bamberg and Vlache and Borsbecca with all appurtenances, which up to now the said Giles and Margaret, his wife, held.  And it should be known that I have quitclaimed the said tithe to the aforesaid church in perpetuity.
	Done at Courtrai in the presence of my people John, lord of Nigelle, castellan of Bruges, lord Arnulf of Oudenarde, lord Baldwin of Prat and lord of Ghistelle.
	In the year of the Lord 1221, on the day following the blessed Mary Magdalen.(1)
