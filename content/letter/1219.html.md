<h2> Translated letter:</h2>On Thursday, the fourth day of the month of July, in the monastery of saints Solutor, Adventor, and Octavius, constructed outside and near the city of Turin, not very far from the gate which is called Susa, in a chamber that is near the chapel of the lord abbot of that monastery, in the presence of lady Agnes, countess, daughter of late William, count, and widow of late Peter, marquis, and (in the presence of) lord Ingo bishop of the holy church of Asti and lord Albert of the holy church of Aix, also a bishop, and lord Guido, marquis, who is said (to be) from Sezzadio and Erenzo, a judge and Bruno from Morocio and Henry from Barono and Ansaldus from Po-longhera and Daniel and Otto, through the staff of the lord Obert, abbot of the above-said monastery, which the lady Adelaide, countess, daughter of late Manfred, marquis, of good memory, and widow of late Odo, also marquis, held in her hand, she gave investiture to the above-noted monastery of saints Solutor, Adventor, and Octavius, into the hand of the aforesaid lord Obert most reverent abbot by name of half of a court that is called Carpice by the countessâ€™ right with appurtenances and all things belonging to that half of the aforesaid court, entirely, whereby the remaining half of the aforesaid court appears to belong to the said monastery with proprietary right and as much as belongs to it, regarding half of another court that is called Coazze with half of appurtenances and all things belonging to that half, whereby a certain Adalric, bishop of the above-noted holy church of Asti, paternal uncle of that lady Adelaide, countess, and a certain lady Bertha, countess, her mother, made a charter of donation to the aforenamed monastery with the tenor that the monks, who now appear to be ordained in that monastery and those who hereafter will be ordained, should do what they will concerning both the aforesaid half of the aforesaid court that is called Carpice with half of all things belonging to it and appurtenances, and concerning that which belonged to it in any way regarding the half of all things and appurtenances belonging to it, fully, for the use of that monastery from the present day with proprietary name, and therefore so that omnipotent and most merciful God might deem it worthy to have pity on the souls of the above-noted late Manfred, marquis, her father and the late lord Adalric, bishop of Asti, her paternal uncle and the late Bertha, countess, her mother, of good memory and the late lord Peter, marquis, her son, in eternal rest, and so that he might grant indulgence to them for all their sins in this life of mortality, and clemency for a future of eternal stability of his most holy contemplation with the company of saints.  Enacted happily in this year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ 1079, on the above-noted Thursday, second indiction.
Sign of the hand of the above-noted lady Adelaide, countess, this writ of her above-noted investiture.
I, Aldeprandus, who am called Bello, notary of the holy palace, was present and wrote the summary of this investiture.1
