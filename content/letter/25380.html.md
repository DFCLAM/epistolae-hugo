<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext51">In the name of the holy and individual trinity.&nbsp; Let it be known to all the faithful of Christ, future as well as present, that I Theoderic, by the grace of God count of Holland and countess Aleide, confirm the gifts which the venerable Petronilla countess of Holland and her son Theoderic conferred on the church of the blessed virgin Mary in Rijnsburg to hold in perpetuity, and we protect it from every objection of our successors with the impression of our seal.&nbsp; Of which [gifts] this is the description:&nbsp; that town Rijnsburg and whatever was in it in their jurisdiction; in the town which is called Nortghe nine manors and a half similarly with all jurisdiction except that the inhabitants have to pay a fifth part of the claim of the count in Nortghe over these; in a certain land which is called Lede, six properties, that is manors, and three properties in Delft, with that right that the officials of the count living in these pay the claims of the count, the free men indeed answer to the church in this manner; besides the whole land and jurisdiction of Alsmer and whatever was in it of their jurisdiction, and also the whole tithe of that land they conferred on said church to hold in perpetuity. I indeed count Theoderic, son of countess Ada, with my wife countess Aleide, wishing to provide for the&nbsp; benefit of the church in Rinsburch for the remedy of our souls, in exchange and compensation for the land and jurisdiction of Aalsmeer, the land in Walchern which is our own, namely twohundred and fifty measures of land to be conferred immutably on said church, which I declare and confirm to be removed in perpetuity from all claim of the count and trouble of those surrounding by the impression of our seal.&nbsp; Witnesses of this thing are:&nbsp; countess Ada, her son Floris, Hugo of Vorne, Nicholas of Haarlem, seneschal Arnold, his brother Henry, Theoderic Bertold, Bartholomew of Voorne, butler Floris, William of Egmund, Gisler of Kerkwerf, Theoderic Neueke.&nbsp; These were enacted in the 1199th year of the incarnation of the lord, with Henry ruling as emperor of the Romans and king of Sicily, and Theoderic of Utrecht presiding as bishop.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext51">In nomine sancte et individue Trinitatis.&nbsp;&nbsp; Notum sit omnibus Christi fidelibus tam futuris quam presentibus quod ego Theodericus&nbsp; Dei gratia comes&nbsp; Hollandie&nbsp; et Aleidis&nbsp; comitissa donaria que venerabilis Petronilla comitissa Hollandie et Theodericus filius eius ecclesie&nbsp; beate virginis Marie in Rinsburch in perpetuum habenda contulerant, confirmamus atque contra omnem posterum nostrorum contradictionem sigilli nostri impressione munimus.
