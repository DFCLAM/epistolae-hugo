<h2> Translated letter:</h2>trans:  To B[erengaria] formerly queen of the English.
That she might punish certain clerics who, having put aside the tonsure and habit, transgressed, and in order to escape punishment, resumed them.
Dated at Ferentini.

Horoy 2.192, 193, <em>Epistolae,</em> 775.html). This is a summary.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2>RHP III, #823
