<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>This is the charter of agreement which the viscount Bernard-Ato and his wife Cecilia and their children made with Rainon of Caylar and with William brother of said Rainon and their men of Caylar, because that viscount Bernard Ato had named to Rainon and his brother William Rainon and all their men of Caylar the common pasturage of Teillan (“patus of Teilan”); but this resolution was made that the men of Caylar would set the boundaries by however much of meadow and earth they were accustomed to hold for working over forty years.&nbsp; This they must show by [the tesimony of] ten men who were from Caylar and Nodel and Teillan, a town not much higher than Armadanegues, this “nobelat” [?] to be proved by ten countrymen of Armadanegues and Nodel and Teillan. … And by this suit and by these said agreements Rainon of Caylar and his brother William and their men of Caylar gave to viscount Bernard-Ato and his wife Cecilia 2000 Melgueil solidos.&nbsp; This was done in the year of the lord’s incarnation 1118 (118 after the millenium), 9th indiction, 4th epact, concurrent 6, Monday, moon …., in the reign of king Louis; and this was done in the presence of these, the bishop of Valencia, the deacon of Posquières, and Pelet, and Elisiar and Bernard Amat and Peter Bernard of Calms, and William Bernard his brother, and Raymond Cantarela and Ralph of Vachères, and William Itero and Peter Itero and Peter Frotard and Pos and Peter Olivedrio and William of Clarensac.&nbsp; William wrote it.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Hec est carta de placito quod fecit vicecomes Bernardus-Ato &amp; uxor sua Cecilia &amp; infantes eorum cum Rainuno de Castlar atque cum Guillelmo fratre supradicti Rainoni necnon cum hominibus eorum de Castlar, quod ipse vicecomes Bernardus-Ato appellaverat Rainoni atque fratri suo Guillelmo Rainoni &amp; omnibus hominibus eorum de Castlar los patus de Teilan; set ita diffinicio facta fuit, quod homines de Castlar terminaverunt terminos quantumcumque prati &amp; terre laborative transactos XL annos tenere solebant.
