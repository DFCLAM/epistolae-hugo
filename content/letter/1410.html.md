<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all that lord Odo Ragot, my faithful, acknowledged in my presence that Pons then lord of Grancey had no right ever in the dwellings of Saint Benigne and of Moytrum and if he had some dwellings there, he had them unjustly and Odo and his heirs released them to me and mine.  Enacted in this one thousand two hundredth twenty seventh year of the Lord.

Actum est hoc anno Domini MoCCo XXoVIIo.
