<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To the most reverent lords and fathers C[onrad] by God’s grace archbishop of the church of Salzburg and R[oman] bishop of the church of Gurk, S[ophia] once daughter of a king now one devout handmaid of those of Admont, obedience submission [and] service of prayer.&nbsp; Having spurned the bedchamber of an earthly prince I desire, though unworthy, to be joined with the eternal king, I fear less to displease your excellence, fathers and lords, since I hear that the good will and action of all men pleases you.&nbsp; Therefore from the whole world I have chosen to serve god in a place [Admont] in your diocese, where I propose to subjugate [myself] to the heavenly spouse under your patronage, if it should please his mercy.&nbsp; The faith and mercy which up to now I have known you to keep with my parents, do not disdain to show to me, though an unworthy and undeserving handmaid; receive me a daughter and handmaid, do not, I ask, deny me paternal love.&nbsp; Move the soul of my brother, now somewhat absent from me, I beseech, by your messengers and your letters and take care to instruct him according to the wisdom given you by god, that he not turn his sibling affection away from me, so that I might exchange the earthly spouse for the heavenly.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Reverentissimis dominis et patribus C.

Quod spreto terreni principis thalamo eterno regi licet indigna copulari desidero, vestre, patres et domini, excellentie eo minus displicere timeo, quo et omnium hominum bonam voluntatem et actionem vobis complacere audio. Ideoque de toto mundo in vestro episcopatu locum N. ad serviendum deo elegi, ubi sub vestro patrocinio celesti sponso, si eius misericordie ita complacuerit, subarrari proposui.
