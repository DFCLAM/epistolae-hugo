<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>E[lizabeth] by the grace of God junior queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present writing, greetings in the true savior. &nbsp;We wish to bring to the notice of all present and future by the contents of these, that since the noble man master Cosmas, son of count<i>/ispán</i> Cosmas, of the Gutkeled kin offered various and many services and actions to the lord Stephen junior king of Hungary, our dearest consort, to us and to the whole kingdom, mostly and particularly many services of deserving fidelity committing himself to the various chances of fortune, that master Cosmas showed to our lord king Stephen in Feketewholun when through the savagery of his relatives he had fled as an exile beyond the boundaries of his kingdom; we, recalling the agreeable services of this king in our reginal memory, donated, gave, and conferred by perpetual right to be possessed and held irrevocably with all its uses and appurtenances on that master Cosmas and through him on his heirs and the successors of those heirs, a certain reginal land or village of ours called Ragáld, in the county<i>/ispánate</i> of Zotmar, next to Eer(Eger?), which is said to have been the land of the <i>jobbágy</i> of Zotmar <em>castrum</em>, who died without an heir, and through lady queen M[aria], our mother-in-law settlers in her name were gathered in that same land and village, which by right of succession devolved to me, in recompense of the services of that master Cosmas.&nbsp; So that the content of this donation and grant of ours may have the force of perpetual stability and cannot in the course of time be revoked or withdrawn by anyone as invalid, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Philip, by the grace of God bishop of Vác, our faithful, chancellor of our court.&nbsp; In the 1265th year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>E.
