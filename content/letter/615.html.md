<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Royal assent to the election and confirmation of Henry de Lexinton, dean of Lincoln, as bishop of that place, with mandate to William de Wylton, guardian of the bishopric, to give him seisin of the bishipric with the castles, lands and tenements belonging to it, together with the crops sown in the lands. saving to the king his outlay in sowing the lands, for the payment of which he is to take security from the bishop.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
