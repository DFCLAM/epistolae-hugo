<h2> Translated letter:</h2>â€¦ they desire with the whole heart, they exult in his coming, since omnipotent God will appear, agreeable to the just and terrible to the injust.  And so your most beloved charity will exhibit itself most devoted to us on this and as long as strength endures, not cease to work so that our request will be accomplished by your urging, we give worthy thanks to you and hold your memory in our prayers to the holy apostles.
Dated 3 Kalends of June, 10th Indiction.

Vestra itaque dillectissima karitas devotissimam se super hoc nobis exhibeat et, quousque vires suppeditant, laborare non cesset, ut, dum vestris hortatibus hec nostra postulatio ad effectum pervenerit, dignas vobis gratias referamus et apud sanctos apostolos in orationibus vestri memoriam habeamus.
Data III Kalendas Iunii, Indictione X.
