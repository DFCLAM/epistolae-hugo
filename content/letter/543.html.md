<h2> Translated letter:</h2>5.136, dated 1262, Jan.11:  Whereas there have been divers questions and controversies about divers articles between the king, of the one part, and Simon de Monteforti, earl of Leicester, and Eleanor his wife, the king's sister, of the other part, and Louis king of the French, has asked the king touching the peace of the earl and countess, the king, desiring to accede to the prayers and wishes of the said king, submits himself in all questions and controversies moved or which could be moved in any articles against the earl and countess or by them against the king, to the award or arbitrament of the said king, so that, after hearing both sides, within a reasonable term to be fixed by him, he may give his award; and the king empowers Ebulo de Montibus and William le Latymer to swear on his soul that he will firmly observe the award.  The king promises this on condition however that the earl and countess submit to the same award and bind themselves in like manner.
By a like letter the king submits himself to the award or arbitrament of M. queen of France and Peter le Chaumberleyn.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>During the disagreements that arose between the king and his brother-in-law, Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, arising out of Simon's pushing the reforms of the Provisions of Oxford, various members of the family attempted to mediate, among them Richard of Cornwall, the king's brother, the queen, Eleanor, her sister, Marguerite, and Marguerite's husband, Louis.  A series of letters dealing with Marguerite's involvement and fully accepting her arbitration if Louis turned it over to her, as he did, are summarized in English in the Calendar of Patent Rolls.
