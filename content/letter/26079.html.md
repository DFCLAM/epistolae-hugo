Ad hoc universalis ecclesie cura nobis a provisore omnium bonorum deo commissa est, ut religiosas diligamus personas et bene placentem deo religionem studeamus modis omnibus propagare. Neque enim deo gratus aliquando famulatus impenditur, nisi ex karitatis radice procedens a puritate religionis fuerit conservatus. Oportet igitur omnes christiane fidei amatores religionem diligere et loca venerabilia cum ipsis personis divino servitio mancipatis attentius confovere, ut nullis pravorum hominum inquietentur molestiis vel importunis angariis fatigentur. Eapropter, dilecte in domino filie, dilecti &lt;filii&gt; nostri Roberti sancte Romane ecclesie presbiteri cardinalis et cancellarii precibus inclinati vestris justis postulationibus clementer annuimus et prefatum beati Johannis baptiste monasterium, in quo divino mancipate estis obsequio, sub beati Petri et nostra protectione suscipimus et presentis scripti privilegio communimus. In primis siquidem statuentes ut ordo monasticus secundum beati Benedicti regulam perpetuis ibi temporibus inviolabiliter conservetur. Quascumque preterea possessiones, quecumque bona in presentiarum juste et canonice possidetis aut in futurum concessione pontificum, liberalitate regum, largitione principum, oblatione fidelium, seu aliis justis modis prestante domino poteritis adipisci, firma vobis vestrisque succedentibus et illibata permaneant. In quibus hec propriis duximus exprimenda vocabulis: monasterium ipsum beate Marie sanctique Johannis baptiste cum possessionibus et insula in qua fundatum est monasterium et aliis appendiciis suis; ex dono Johannis de Sancto Johanne et dono Reginaldi de Sancto Walerico terram que vocatur Godestowe cum pertinentiis, molendinum de Wulgarecote, duos mansos in Wolgarescote cum appendiciis suis, insulam que jacet inter duas aquas ante portam monasterii vestri, prata tria scilicet Boiham Lichesham et Heringesham, piscariam unam super Tamisiam cum appendiciis suis, dimidium pratum quod vocatur Lambeia; alteram medietatem eiusdem prati ex dono Roberti de Oilli cum modio uno frumenti annuatim de molendino sub castello Oxenefordii; ecclesiam sancti Egidii que est extra Oxeneford'; ex dono Alexandri Lincoln' episcopi C. s. de teloneo Banneberie annuatim vobis persolvendos; (fo. 184) ex dono regis Stephani centum solidatas terre in Waltono, nundinas trium dierum ad nativitatem sancti Johannis baptiste apud Godestowe; ex dono Rogeri Saresberiensis episcopi molendinum quod dicitur Boiemilne cum terris et appendiciis suis, mansos duos apud sanctum Clementem; ex dono Reginaldi filii comitis et Emeline uxoris eius Eatonam cum omnibus pertinentiis suis; in Halso lx. s. de terra quam dedit Robertus comes Leicestrie; ex dono civium Oxeneford' terram que vocatur Wica in in Portmaneit; quicquid juris habetis in ecclesia Wadhille; ex dono Hugonis de Tywa novem solidatas terre in Oxeneford'; ex dono Sevari septem solidatas terre extra Nordgatam; ex dono Nicholai Basset unam hidam terre in Risendona; ex dono Rogeri de Almeri quinquaginta acras in Blechesdon'; in eadem villa unam virgatam terre et quinque acras ex dono Walteri de Peri; in Cnolla terram quam dedit vobis Radulphus Waifer, terram que vocatur Sandford'; ex dono Roberti de Wictham partem prati juxta Godestowam; ex dono Ailwini filii Godegos xviii. solidatas terre extra portam Oxeneford' australem; in Estchepe apud Londonias xvii. solidatas terre; in Wintonia quinque solidatas terre ex dono Ambrosii; ex dono Radulphi vicecomitis et Matillidis uxoris sue Sci’lingford'; quicquid juris habetis in decimis de Rollendrith'; xx. s. de ecclesia Ferendone ex dono Roberti Exoniensis episcopi annuatim persolvendos; ex ipsius etiam dono xx. s. de ecclesia sancte Marie Gloucestrie annuatim persolvendos. Preter hec autem sancimus ut in cenobiis que de monasterio vestro egressa sunt et instituta vestra tenent, nulla alterius ordinis abbatissa seu priorissa preponatur. Obeunte vero te nunc eiusdem loci priorissa vel tuarum qualibet succedentium nulla ibi qualibet subreptionis astutia seu violentia preponatur, nisi quam sorores communi consensu vel sororum pars consilii sanioris secundum dei timorem- et beati Benedicti regulam providerint eligendam. Decernimus ergo ut nulli omnino hominum liceat prefatum locum temere perturbare aut eius possessiones auferre vel ablatas retinere, minuere seu quibuslibet vexationibus fatigare sed omnia integra conserventur eorum, pro quorum gubernatione et sustentatione concessa sunt, usibus omnimodis profutura, salva sedis apostolice auctoritate et diocesani episcopi canonica justitia et reverentia. Si qua igitur in futurum ecclesiastica secularisve persona hujus nostre constitutionis paginam sciens contra eam temere &lt;venire&gt; temptaverit, secundo terciove commonita, si non reatum suum congrua satisfactione correxerit, potestatis honorisque sui dignitate careat reamque se divino judicio existere de perpetrata iniquitate cognoscat et a sacratissimo corpore et sanguine dei et domini redemptoris nostri Jhesu Christi aliena fiat atque in extremo examine districte ultioni subjaceat. Cunctis autem eidem loco sua jura servantibus sit pax domini nostri Jhesu Christi, quatinus et hic fructum bone actionis percipiant et apud districtum judicem premia eterne pacis inveniant.
