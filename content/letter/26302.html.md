<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Maria by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present writing greetings in the saviour of all.&nbsp; The prudent consideration and considered weighing by kings and princes ought to respond with very sollicitous spirit to distribute to each one according to the merits of loyal servants, the more willingly to cause them to show the desired and more prompt services.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by the contents of these that we, giving attention to the merits of loyalty and the multitude of services of count/<i>ispán</i> Bartholomew of Vecse our faithful knight, which he supplied to our lord Béla, illustrious king, to us, and to the kingdom in various expeditions and other most arduous matters and especially considering how once fighting laudably under the castle/<em>castrum</em> of Krislak he was seriously shot by arrow in the eye, as well as how many and what wounds he received afterwards in Styria at the <em>castrum</em> called Marpurg, and was captured there and suffered the miseries of long captivity and the great quantity of money he spent to free his person, rehearsing moreover how at last when he was returning in the legation of the lord king from the king of Bohemia, he was captured by the son of that king of Bohemia and, long held in torment, barely avoided the danger of death when the one who was assigned to guard him was killed; and wishing to meet with suitable rewards as is fitting that count Bartholomew for so many and such services of loyalty, which it would be too long to tell one by one for their multiplicity, we conferred, gave, and donated certain lands of ours, situated in Árkibánya, namely Keszi, Szelöce and Szerböc in the county/<i>ispán</i> of Nyitra, also our land called Gány in the county/<i>ispán </i>of Pozsony with all their uses under the boundaries and limits by which our people are known to have possessed and held them, to said count Bartholomew and his heirs and successors of those heirs to be possessed by perpetual right from the fullness of our grace.&nbsp; So that the content of this our donation may have the force of perpetual stability and may not in the course of time be withdrawn by anyone, we have given the presents to&nbsp; that count Bartholomew strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of master Lawrence, provost of St. Ireneus, vice-chancellor of our court in the 1268th year of the Lord.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p><span>Maria Dei gratia regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus presens scriptum inspecturis salutem in omnium salvatore.
