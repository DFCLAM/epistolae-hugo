<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Appointment, during pleasure, of William de Wylton to keep the lands and castles late of William de Ferrariis the younger, somtime earl of Derby, so that he answer for the issues at the Exchequer.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
