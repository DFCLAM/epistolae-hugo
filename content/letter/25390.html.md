<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext41">To her beloved lord John, by the grace of God illustrious king of England, Adelaide countess of Holland, greetings and ready/willing service.</p><p class="Bodytext41">Be it known to his royal majesty that the count of Loon took my daughter, who has been honorably received by your mercy, may the almighty God give her back to us, as his lawful wife, as he ought, and received her from the hand of count Otto of Bentheim, who was the paternal uncle of my lord of good memory and, as I may say truthfully, was with her in the lawful marriage-bed only 18 [28] days.&nbsp;</p><p class="Bodytext41">After which, and I tell this with a sigh and sorrow, when the count and I were expelled in the same way, my daughter was known to be sent to your parts, through God’s agency, for my as well as her salvation, since her captivity in Frisia had been intolerable to her; therefore I send your royal majesty, for whom compassion is always appropriate, the present page and prayers, asking humbly that in God’s sight you give back an innocent soul, long a captive, to her friends, and do not believe the whisperers who make up and tell you lies out of envy.&nbsp; You should also know that my said daughter was given to the count in the presence of many noble men, officials of the land of Holland, by whose counsel and assent the thing was done, whose names are these:&nbsp; Roger of Merheim, Hugo of Voorne, Theoderic of Altena, Simon and John and Isbrand of Haarlem, William of Theylinge, Walpert and Floris of Lede, Arnand and Henry of Riswick, Walter of Egmund and many of the men and officials of Holland, whose names it would be [too] long to list.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p class="Bodytext21">Domino suo dilecto Johanni Dei gratia illustri regi Angliae, Adelheidis comitissa Hollandie salutem et paratum obsequium.</p><p class="Bodytext21">Majestati sit notum regiae, quod comes de Los filiam meam, quae apud vestram misericordiam est honeste recepta, quam nobis reddat Deus omnipotens, in uxorem legitimam duxit ut debuit, et accepit eam de manu comitis Otonis de Benetheym, qui fuit patruus domini bonae memoriae, et, ut verum fatear, cum eo fuit in thoro legitimo 18 [leg.28] diebus tantum.</p><p class="Bodytext21">Post quod dies, quod vobis cum gemitu et cum dolore significo, expulso comite et me similiter, filia mea ad partes vestras, agente Domino, tam ad meam quam ad ejus salutem transmissa dinoscitur, quia <i>captivitas ejus in Frisia intolerabilis ei fuit</i> ; ergo majestati regiae, cui semper est proprium misereri, praesentem paginam et preces porrigo, rogans humiliter, quatenus intuitu Dei, innocentem animam, longo tempore captivatam, reddatis amicis, et susurronibus, qui vobis invidiae causa mendacia fingunt et proferunt, non credatis.&nbsp; Sciatis etiam quod praedicta filia mea data est comiti in praesentia multorum nobilium hominum, ministerialium de terra Holand, quorum consilio et assensu res facta est, quorum nomina sunt haec:&nbsp; Rogerus de Merehun [l. Merehem], Hugo de Worn [l.Vorn], Theodoricus de Alcena [l.Altena], Simon et Johannes et Isbrand de Harlen [l.Harlem], Willielmus de Teylinge, Walpertus et Florentinus de Leda, Arnand et Henr. de Riswic, Walterus de Egmund et multi hominum et ministerialium de terra Holondiae, quorum nomina vobis exponere longum esset.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The countess writes to the king asking for the release of her daughter, Ada, and includes a strong statement of the legitimacy of the daughter's marriage, which had occurred very soon after her father's death.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ada succeeded her father as Countess of Holland, but rather than let Ada’s uncle William serve as her regent, Adelaide had her swiftly married to Louis, count of Loon.&nbsp; William, however, contested her rule and defeated and then exiled Louis and Adelaide.&nbsp; He captured Ada, who was kept detained first in Frisia, then in England.&nbsp; There is a document recording money King John spent for clothes for her and her servants 11 marks, 10 shillings:&nbsp; “Rex baroni de Scaccario etc.&nbsp; Computate Regine de Cornhull undecim marcas et decem solidos et tres denarios quos posuit in robis comitisse Hoyland et servientium suorum per preceptum nostrum.&nbsp; Teste W. Briw apud Lameh, XVI die Apr. anno regni nostri VIII, per magistrum Gillebertim per regem.”&nbsp; <em>Oorkondenboek van Holland en Zeeland</em>, uitgegeven van wege de Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen.&nbsp; Eerste Afdeeling tot het einde van het Hollandsche Huis bewerkt door Mr. L.
