<h2> Translated letter:</h2>A small spark sent from the seat of great majesty and a voice thundering in the heart of a small worm-person shouts to the sisters of the Holy Virgins in Cologne, saying:
My daughters are like those forsaken and they have vanished in their vanities.  Like a reed blown back and forth by the wind, so are my daughters in all their ways.  The Lord says, “Your foot tramples on the blood of my saints which is poured out on the earth.  From under your feet they accuse you, saying to me, Why do you not avenge us, Lord Sabaoth?  This people does not revere us.  We who have endured great things for you are honored by but few of their great number; the earth and its kind scorn us.’”
Behold, daughters, you have stained the bed in which I should be resting with my saints.  Return to your heart and recall how your predecessors went before you with all humility and chastity and how they loved their celestial Bridegroom.  They imitated Him in their death and so were crowned  and received the palm branch. Turn from your ways and follow them and be prepared so that when your Bridegroom comes and knocks at your door, you can open immediately and lead Him into your heart.  Indeed, if it is pleasing to Him for you to be there, He will give you a named place in His kingdom.  May He deign to offer you this, He who is now and forever will be, and His reign will be without end.  Amen. (1)
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Quedam parva scintilla emissa de sede magne maiestatis, et vox tonans in cor cuiusdam vermiculi hominis clamat ad sorores sanctarum virginum in Colonia dicens:  Filie mee sunt quasi derelicte, et evanuereunt in vanitatibus suis, et sicut harundo, que a vento movetur huc atque illuc, sic sunt filie mee in omnibus viis suis, dicit dominus:  Sangiunem sanctorum meorum, qui effusus est in terram, calcat pes vester, et sub pedibus vestris sunt, qui accusant vos coram me, dicentes:  Quare non vindicas nos domine Sabaoth, qui gens ista non reveretur nos, et in multis pauci sunt, qui nos honorant, qui magna sustinuimus propter te, sed calcat nos terra cum genere suo.  Ecce filie maculastis lectum meum, in quo requiescere debueram cum sanctis meis.  Redite ad cor et recordamini, quomodo precesserunt vos antecessores vestre cum omni humilitate et castitate et amaverunt sponsum suum celestem.  Imitate sunt etiam eum in morte sua, ideoque coronatur et accipiunt palmam.  Comnvertimini a viis vestris et sequimini eas, et estote parate, ut, quando veniet sponsus vester et sequimini eas, et estote parate, ut, quando veniet sponsus vester et pulsabit ad ostium cordis vestri, confestim aperiatis ei, et introducatis eum ad cor vestrum.  Certe si placuerit ei esse ibi, dabit vobis locum nominatum in regno suo.  Quem vobis prestare dignetur, qui nunc est et semper erit et regni eius non erit finis.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>This letter originally circulated appended to the revelations about the virgins of Cologne, following the letter now in ch. 5 of the collected letters, and introduced by this sentence: “Likewise, at another time God placed these words on my lips.”
