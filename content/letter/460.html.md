<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The pope grants that if her land should be placed under interdict, her chaplain can celebrate divine offices behind closed doors and with excommunicates kept out.  He would, however, excommunicate her and her husband Hugh a few years later, see letters of 1220, 1222.
