<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Appointment of William Trussell and Giles de Erdinton to extend by jury the lands late of W. de Ferariis, earl of Derby,a nd to send the same to the king’s council, to wit, what they are worth yearly in demesnes, homages, rents, villeinages, woods, meadows, pastures, and all other issues.
By the queen and earl.
Afterwards these letters were changed, and this clause was added:  that they enquire how many knights’ fees were held of the earl, and what they are worth yearly; how many advowsons of churches belonged to him and what each church was worth by the year.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
