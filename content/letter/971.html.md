<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[About his absence]
If the excessively rainy air did not prevent me,
though you would not know, the loving one would have sought you again.
Nor do I, now absent wanted to be detained one hour,
when my light/life is when the loving one is seen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>[De absentia sua]
Si me non nimium pluviatilis aura vetaret,
dum nesciretis, vos repetisset amans.
nec volo nunc absens una detenter ut hora,
cum mea tunc lux est quando videtur amans.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>Bishop Venantius Fortunatus met Agnes and her patron Radegund when he visited Poitiers. They became good friends and exchanged epistolary poems and small gifts until the women died.
