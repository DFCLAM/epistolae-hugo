<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I Odo, duke of Burgundy, make known to the present and the future that I accept, approve and grant what the lord Philip king of France did towards Thibaut, the son of my beloved faithful and relative Thibaut, late count of Champagne, and my beloved and faithful Blanche, countess of Champagne, and towards that Blanche, countess of Champagne, as is fully contained in the charter that king made about it.&nbsp; Namely, that said Thibaut and his mother countess Blanche should not and cannot be drawn into a suit for anything that Thibaut’s father held when he died, until said Thibaut shall have completed his twenty first year;&nbsp; since such is the usage and custom in France, and it is just, that noone should be accountable within the first twenty one years of his life for anything his father held without challenge when he died.&nbsp; Thus I therefore accept and approve, and I grant to said Thibaut and his mother countess Blanche that if anyone wishes to draw them into a suit for anything that pertains to my fief, I would not hear that suit, nor would anyone on my part, until said Thibaut shall have completed his twenty first year:&nbsp; rather I would help them in every way.&nbsp; – After said Thibaut shall have completed his twenty first year, or even before, if it pleased said countess Blanche his mother, I would receive him as my man for all things which the [grand]father count Henry held from my father, and count Thibaut, son of said count Henry, held from me.&nbsp; – Which that it be held firm, I have strengthened the present charter with the fortification of my seal. – Enacted in the 1209th year of the Lord, in the month of January.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego Odo dux Burgundie notum facio presentibus et futuris quod ego laudo, approbo et concedo illud quod dominus Philippus rex Francie fecit erga Theobaldum, filium dilecti fidelis et consanguinei mei Theobaldi, quondam comitis Campanie, et dilecte et fidelis mee Blanche comitisse Campanie , et erga ipsam Blancham comitissam Campanie, sicut in carta ipsius regis inde habita plenius continetur. Videlicet, quod dictus Theobaldus et Blancha ma­ter ejus comitissa nec debent nec possunt trahi in causam de aliquo quod pater ipsius Theobaldus teneret quando decessit, quoadusque dictus Theo­baldus vicesimum primum compleverit annum; quia usus et consuetudo talis est in regno Francie, et justum est, quod nullus respondere debet infra vicesimum primum etatis sue annum de aliquo quod pater ejus teneret sine placito , quando decessit. Quoniam igitur illud laudo et approbo, concedo prefatis Theobaldo et Blanche comitisse matri ejus quod , si aliquis velit eos trahere in causam de aliquo quod ad feodum meum pertinent, ego non audirem inde causam, nec aliquis ex parte mea, donec sepedictus Theobaldus vicesimum primum compleverit annum; inmo ipsos inde in omnibus adjuvarem. — Postquam vero dictus Theobaldus vicesimum primum compleverit annum, vel eciam ante, si dicte Blanche comitisse matri ejus placuerit, ego recipiam cum in hominem de omnibus que comes Henricus pater tenuit de patre meo et que comes Theobaldus, filius dicti comitis Henrici, de me tenuit. —Quod ut ratum habeatur, presentem cartam sigilli mei munimine roboravi. — Actum anno Domini M° CC° nono, mense januario.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The duke accepts the agreement made between Philip, king of France, and the countess, that no suits could be brought against her and her son, Thibaut, for their holdings before Thibaut reaches the age of twenty-one. &nbsp;At which point, the duke will receive Thibaut as his man for the holdings his father and grandfather held from the duke and his father.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Layettes du Trésor des Chartes, </i>1.344-45, #910.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1209-10, January.
