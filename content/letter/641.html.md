<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Mandate to Master W. Kilkenny to make the king’s peace by the seal of England to William Bissop, who withdrew from the realm because he beat Agatha his wife in the house of Brice the Barber at Oxford, if it be found by inquisition that he withdrew for no other offence.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
