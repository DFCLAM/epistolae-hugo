<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Grant to Robert de Cadamo, who is coming personally with the queen to the king in Gascony, that his servants and mariners of his ship called La Blithe may take it where they will until the king’s return from Gascony.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
<h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><em>Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry III, 1247-58</em>, 4.; summary in English.(1)</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>05/10/1254
