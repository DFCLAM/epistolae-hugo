<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all that, excepting allegiance to the countess of  Chalon I received as my liege man lord William of Chapelle for what Reynald Beledenz and Parisius, chamberlain of Chalon, held from the duke of Burgundy in fief, namely for eight days in the ban(1) of Beaune and twenty pounds in the toll of Beaune, and from the men whom Robert Beledenz had at Beaune and from what he had at Ducort and in the tithe of Corgoloin, as long as said William will live and Amelina, his wife, widow of Parisius the chamberlain of Chalon.  After their deaths everything named above will revert freely and absolutely to me and my son in perpetuity, unless said William should have a son or daughter from said Amelina, who would succeed them.  Enacted in this 1220th year of the Lord, on the day after the Resurrection of the Lord.

Post decessum vero eorum, totum illud quod superius est nominatum revertetur libere et absolute ad me et ad filium meum in perpetuum, nisi dictus Willelmus de dicta Amelina filium vel filiam haberet, qui eis succederet. Actum est hoc anno Domini millesimo ducentesimo vicesimo, in crastino Resurrectionis Dominice.
