<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Blanche, palatine countess of Troyes, make known to all present and future, that of the 40 pounds which the men of Chaource gave me through the deliberation of Thibaut, my son, under the protection of the lord king, Roland, the abbot of the monastery of Montiéramey, gave me half, which he ought by law to have according to the witness of the charter of count Henry.  And, lest there be any prejudice to this charter over this in the future, at the request of said abbot, I wished the present letter(s) to be done in witness of this thing, namely that his part, the half, which he ought to have by law in the foresaid 40 pounds, he freely gave me.
So that it remain known, I have strengthened the letter(s) recorded with the protection of my seal.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Ego, Blancha, comitissa Trecensis palatina, notum facio universis tam presentibus quam futuris, quod de quadringintis libris, quas homines de Chaorsis michi dederunt pro deliberatione Theobaldi, filii mei, de custodia domini regis dedit michi abbas monasterii Arremarensis Rolandus medietatem, quam de jure debebat habere juxta testimonium carte comitis Henrici.  Et, ne huic carte super hoc prejudicium fieret in futurum, ad petitionem dicti abbatis presentes litteras fieri volui in testimonium hujus rei, videlicet quod partem suam, scilicet medietatem, quam in predictis quadringintis libris de jure debebat habere, liberaliter michi dedit.
Quod ut notum permaneat, litteris annotatum sigilli mei munimime roboravi.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The countess declares that the 40 pounds freely given to her by the abbot of Montiéramey should not constitute any prejudice to the agreement by which that money is his.
