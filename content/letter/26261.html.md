<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth, by the grace of God, queen of Hungary, to all the faithful of Christ, present as well as future who will see the present writing, eternal salvation/greetings in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the world, fixed on evil in many and multifarious ways, daily generates new disputes, justice might easily be exiled beyond the limits of the world unless the strength and force of the testimony of letters refrains the attempts of the accusers and the kinds of fabricated struggles.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by the contents of these, that since a noble man, Mojs, palatine of good memory, possessed certain lands or villages, namely those called Kazsok,&nbsp; Ráksi,&nbsp;Béc, Farnas and Csap, in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Tolna, peacefully during his life, and then after the death of that palatine Mojs, those lands or villages, were unduly alienated from master Mojs, son of the said palatine Mojs and received by lady Maria, illustrious queen of Hungary of happy memory, our dearest grandmother:&nbsp; yet since lord king Béla and lady Maria, his dearest consort were taken from&nbsp; [our] midst, it was arranged and established in a common gathering and assembly of all the nobles and chiefs of the kingdom, with the advice and good will of lord king Stephen, our father-in-law, and lady queen Elizabeth, his consort, our beloved mother-in-law, that the possessions of whatever nobles which had been unduly alienated, should be given back and restored with all right:&nbsp; among other things, that lady queen Elizabeth had the facts about said villages or lands committed to the investigation of the venerable father, lord Philip bishop of Vác, chancellor of her court; and since the facts by diligent investigation of that venerable father showed that said lands or villages pertained in the right and property of the master Mojs, she gave back and restored [them] to him according to the form of her charter composed for that purpose, with all their rights and appurtenances, as they had been obtained and possessed by his father, the palatine Mojs.&nbsp; And so we not wishing to fail any nobles of our kingdom in their rights, abandoned and let go said lands and villages to that master Mojs, to be possessed with all their appurtenances; confirming the order made by lady queen Elizabeth, our dearest mother-in-law, and her charter over the restitution of the lands or villages by the authority of the presents.&nbsp; In witness and perpetual stability of which thing, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father lord Philip bishop of Vác, our loyal chancellor of our court.&nbsp; In the thousand two hundred seventy sixth year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth, Dei gratia, Regina Hungariae, omnibus Christi fidelibus, tam praesentibus, quam futuris, praesens scriptum inspecturis, salutem in Domino sempiternam.&nbsp; Quia mundus in maligno positus multifarie, multisque modis, quotidie noua iurgia generat, iustitia de facile extra mundi terminos exularet, nisi conatus calumniantium, et genera litium fabricantium, vigor et robur testimonii litterarum refroenaret.&nbsp;
