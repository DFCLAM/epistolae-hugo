<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Memorandum that on Saturday after the Ascension at Winchester the following letter from the king was handed to the queen, dated at Bazas, 10 February, acquitting all the men of the commune of Bordeaux and their heirs, in consideration of their past service, from all exaction and prise of tuns (tonellorum) of wine exported by them to England, Ireland, Wales, or other the king's land, except the ancient prise of two tuns from every ship, one fore and one aft, and for these the price shall be paid according to the various ports as of old used to be paid, but the customs of pence (denar') imposed upon every tun in the divers ports, shall be paid by merchants in the manner and form in which they used to be paid there.  The king promises to defend them from every other exaction and prise and will not permit any of his bailiffs or ministers of his wines to receive any other exaction or prise.  As a further grace the king grants that after any ship with wine has put into port, the bailiff who holds the office of the prise shall not postpone taking the said two tuns of prise beyond eight days, so that the merchants may not suffer loss through the procrastination or ignorance of the bailiff or through his malicious absence.  And for their greater security Peter de Monteforti has sworn on the king's soul that the king will observe these conditions without diminution.  And that no challenge of this grant may arise the king has confirmed it by the subscription of witnesses and the authority of his seal, the following being present, P. bishop of Hereford, W. bishop of Bath and Wells, John de Plessetis, earl of Warwick, Peter de Sabaudia, William de Valencia, the king's brother, William de Cantilupo, John de Grey, Robert Walerand, William de Grey, Drew de Barentin and others.
