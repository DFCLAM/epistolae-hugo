<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Matilda, by the grace of God if she is anything, to all those dwelling in the kingdom of the Germans, greetings.
We make known to you that the false king Henry stole the seal of the lord pope Gregory by theft.(1)   Wherefore if you should hear anything that does not accord with our legation's report, consider it false.  Do not acquiesce to his lies.  Moreover he brings the bishop of Ostia with him, since he was long a member of the lord pope's household.  If therefore he wishes to do anything with you or against you through him, do not doubt that he is a false witness.  Do not believe anything from anyone who dares to say other than what we say.  You should know that the lord pope has already recovered Sutri and Nepi.  Barrabas the thief, Henry's pope, has also fled.  Be well and be wary of Henry's plots.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Mathildis Dei gratia si quid est, omnibus in Theuthonicorum regno commorantibus, salutem.  Notum vobis facimus, quod Heinricus falsus rex furto subripuit sygillum domni papae Gregorii.  Unde si quid audieritis quod discordet a nostra legatione, falsum arbitramini, neque mendaciis eius adquiescatis.  Preterea episcopum Portuensem secum ducit; quoniam olim fuit familiaris domini papae.  Si igitur aliquid vobiscum vel contra vos per eum vult operari, eum falsum testem nolite dubitare.  Nulli umquam credatis, qui aliter quam nos dicere audebit.  Sciatis domnum papam iam recuperasse Sutrium atque Nepe.  Barrabas latro, id est Heinrici papa, ipse quoque aufugit.  Valete, et de insidiis Heinrici cauti estote.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>Matilda's letter, cited by Hugh of Flavigny in his Chronicle, warns against accepting what comes from the anti-pope Clement III or from the emperor Henry in the pope's name.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1)Henry IV was not crowned emperor until 1084 and was recognized only as king of the Germans by the pope and many of his supporters.  The theft of the seal occurred when Henry's troops invaded Rome.
