<h2> Translated letter:</h2>H. by God’s grace elect of Liège, to all who will view the present letters, greeting.
	May all your society know that, since regarding the dispute that had arisen between the most serene lord William, renowned king of the Romans and Floris, his brother on one side and on the other the noble matron Margaret countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, over rights and other things which each party claimed to belong to itself in the land of Zeeland, with the venerable father lord P. mediating, bishop of Alban, legate of the apostolic see, peace has been restored between them, as is contained more fully in their letters prepared thenceforth; we at the request of said lord king, for the preservation of said peace give our present letters, promising by testimony of the present letters that if it were to happen that either of the said parties breaks the said peace or challenges it, we will provide assistance and counsel to the one protecting the peace, against the one breaking it.
	Granted at Mons in Hainaut on the day of blessed apostle Andrew, in the year of the Lord 1250.(1)

Noverit universitas vestra quod, cum super questione inter serenissimum dominum W. regem II Romanorum illustrem et Florentium, germanum ipsius, ex una parte et nobilem matronam M. Flandrie et Haynonie comitissam ex altera Suborta super iuribus et aliis que utraque pars ad se pertinere dicebat in terra Zelandie, mediante venerabili patre domino P. Albanensi episcopo, apostolice sedis legato, pax sit reformata inter eos, prout in eorum litteris exinde confectis plenius continetur, nos ad petitionem dicti domini regis super dicte pacis conservatione presentes litteras nostras damus, promittentes nos presentium testimonio litterarum, si dictam pacem alteram dictarum partium infringere contingeret vel venire contra eam, servanti pacem contra infringentem auxilium et consilium prestituros.
