<h2> Translated letter:</h2>The supereminent authority of your serenity, which proclaims by the course of prosperity that you rule the state most happily, exhorts us efficaciously, if it please Christ, to extend the bonds of friendship.  Therefore, most reverently discharging the observances of greeting to your most serene glory, [we indicate that] we directed our legates, bearers of the presents, to the presence of the most pious emperor or yours, in the zeal for common benefit, and when you have worthily received them, advise the most serene prince that it will benefit the lands of both peoples associated by the grace of peace, who are equally bound by sincere affection with Christ’s help.

Quapropter serenissime gloriae vestre salutis officia reverentissime persolventes, [significamus], praesentium legatarios nostros ad piissimi augusti vel vestram praesentiam fiducialiter communis utilitatis nos studio direxisse, quibus dignanter receptis, illud serenissimo principi adhibete consilii, quod utrisque gentibus pacis gratia sociatas proficiat partibus, quas pariter sinceros praestante Christo nectit affectus.
