&nbsp;In a will made by Bernard Ermengol, who had previously held Fornells, on May 3, 1048 (LFM&nbsp;&nbsp;1.450-52 #431), he says that if he has a son, the son and his mother should be under the protection of the count and countess, if no son is born, Fornells should revert to them.&nbsp; Apparently no son was born so they commit Fornells to Hugh and Adalgard.&nbsp; A <em>castrum</em> is an administrative unit with a castle at the center.</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Liber Feudorum Maior</i> (LFM), ed.
