<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Appointment of John de Lexinton and Geoffrey de Langele, in the room of Thomas de Staunford, escheator beyond Trent, to extend the lands late of Ralph de Levinton in England; and the sheriff of Cumberland is commanded to provide a jury.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
