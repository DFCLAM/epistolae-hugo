<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth, by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present writing greetings in the saviour of all.&nbsp; We wish to bring to the notice of all present and future by the contents of these, that we having considered and looked over the deserving services and serving merits of our faithful master Aladarius son of Csete (Cheche) and desiring to recall to light his good services which from the early years of his boyhood he showed faithfully to lord Béla our father-in-law and afterwards to lord Stephen our consort, [both] beloved and of pious memory, formerly most serene kings of Hungary, and to the kingdom, submitting himself and his things devotedly to us in the different turns of fortune, for which he ought to be rewarded with reginal generosity greater and more fully in reginal bestowals, though it may seem small, than we do at present.&nbsp; In respect of what we intend to do for him in the future, a certain land called Oryavicha in the county/<i>ispánate </i>of Pozsega, which Peter son of Chelleus held from royal gift and possessed and which through his death without the comfort of heirs fell to our hands through the approved custom of our kingdom; it was first conferred on that master Aladarius through our mother-in-law, dearest lady Maria formerly most serene queen of Hungary, who had the right to conferring and giving that land, with the permission and consent of said lord Béla formerly king, and given because said master Aladarius had reported the first fruits of joys of the birth of our dearest son king Ladislaus and because lord Stephen our dearest consort had moved against that master Aladarius.&nbsp; After it was revoked and transferred to the rule of different persons, with the good will and consent of that same our dearest son king Ladislaus and all the barons of our kingdom, we gave back and restored, rather we give and confer on that master Aladarius and through him on his heirs and successors of his heirs to be possessed by perpetual right irrrevocably in that custom and freedom by which the possessions of other nobles of Pozsega like former bans* of the land of Borych were possessed and within the same boundary limits and subscribed circumstances by which it was formerly limited, having noted expressly that all instruments and privileges/charters or whatever protections had flowed on the donation, conference and transfer of the mentioned land to Nicholas son of Lawrence or any other inhabitants of our kingdom in any way by trick or order up to the date of the presents, are held broken and invalid and voided; only the content of the present letters about our present donation and bestowal to the oftmentioned master Aladarius have force, strength, and power. We have conceded and granted also that if it happens that said master Aladarius should, let it no be so, be deprived of the solace of an heir, he would have the free and absolute ability to bequeath, give, alienate from himself or dispose of it to whomever he might wish in life or in death.&nbsp;</p><p>The course of the boundaries of said possession of Oryavicha as count/<i>ispán</i> Geleth our man and the testimony of the chapter of St. Peter of Pozsega, transmitted for us to the present neighbors and boundary sharers of that possession with the range and limit at the time of its fixing, with no opposition from anyone, as they put it in the record for us to that master Aladarius, are designated thus.&nbsp; The first boundary of that possession of Oryavicha begins from the north in a certain rise (<i>berch)</i> above the chapel built in honor of St. Luke the evangelist and from there westward in that <i>berch</i> namely from the side of Oryavicha castle it comes to a certain wall (<i>harazth)</i> in the south, under which is a land boundary and descending south from there by a small path it comes to a large pear tree, from here it turns west between the Oryavicha river and rises in a certain valley and crosses a certain <i>berch</i>, moving somewhat southward and comes to a <i>berekyne </i>tree, under which is a land boundary and from there moving southward it comes to a certain stream called Zwynzk creek and from there moving westward it falls into a certain river called Krytwacha creek and thence through a wood into a large space somewhat to the south and moving west falls into a certain bowl (<i>kalysta</i>) in the middle of Book forest and thence going straight it falls into the Zawa river and then in the course of the Zawa river it comes out of that Zawa river where Oryavicha creek falls into Zawa and thence it turns east and reaches Precopa, where through a canal the river Oryave, it falls into said Oryavicha creek and moving from there north in a good space it reaches a poplar tree under which is a land boundary that separates it from the Dragouch possession and from there moving north it comes to the river Jelsevyk, thence north it comes to a certain <i>berch</i> and from there moving north next to the Garad creek land it come to a certain ruined land in a berch called Omlas in the vulgate and from there turning west it descends to the Oryavicha river where it ends.&nbsp; In memory and permanent stability of which we have granted the present letters fortified by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Philip, bishop of Vachyensis, chancellor of our court, our faithful count/<i>ispan</i> of Nógrád (Neugradiensis), in the thousand two hundred seventy seventh year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elyzabeth dei gracia regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus presens scriptum inspecturis salutem in omnium saluatore.&nbsp;
