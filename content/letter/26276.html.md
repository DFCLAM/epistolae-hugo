<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful who will look at the present letters, greetings in the bestower of salvation.&nbsp; It is suitable that we weigh the merits of those devoted to the royal crown and to us with on the scale of generosity, by which we may enflame their souls with the munificence of teeming grace more effectively to the service of ready loyalty.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by the content of the presents:&nbsp; that coming into our presence, Cosmas, son of Bágyon, master of our chamber, count Peter, son of Matthew, and Gregory son of Nicholas, our young faithful, asked that they be given by us a certain land of our heralds/criers called Büssü in the territory of Somogy and Tolna county. Truly since the truth about the quality and quantity of that land is not fully known to us, we gave letters with commands to our faithful, the chapter of Fejér (Alba), that they send one of theirs as witness in the presence of our tavarnok Paul going to said land who would walk it with those who shared boundaries and neighbors present, and establish for them, master Cosmas, count Peter, and Gregory, our youths, if it is not opposed, calling the objecters to our court; and afterward they would report back the quality and quantity of that land to us in their letters.&nbsp; Who afterward wrote back to us in these words:&nbsp; [see 26275.html]<br>. . .<br>So we, pressed by the office of the direction undertaken to measure and weigh the merits of each and to respond to each according to the need of their merits,the commendable fidelity and pleasing services of those master Cosmas and count Peter and Gregory which they showed us with highest loyalty, they could show in future, expecting with customary benevolence and wishing to respond to their so many acceptable services and offices with the benefit of remuneration, we gave, donated and conferred the perviously named land Büssü of our heralds/criers, to be possessed perpetually and peacefully, with all its uses, expansions and appurtenances, within the boundaries and ancient distinctions of limits, to said master Cosmas, count Peter, and Gregory, and their heirs and successors of their heirs, is some recompense for their services, though they deserve much more.&nbsp; So that this donation of ours may obtain the force of perpetual stability, and can not be withdrawn at any time, we granted the present letters from the plenitude of our grace, strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Thomas, by the grace of God, bishop of Vác, our faithful chancellor of our court, and count of Pilis.&nbsp; In the 1284th year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth, Dei gracia, regina Vngarie, omnibus Christi fidelibus, presentes litteras inspecturis, salutem in salutis largitore.&nbsp;
