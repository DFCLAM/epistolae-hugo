<h2> Translated letter:</h2>In the name of Christ.  I countess Rangard, who was daughter of countess Amelia, am the seller to you lord Raymond count of Barcelona, and countess Almodis your wife my sister, and your son Raymond- Berengar.  By this writing of my sale I sell you all warrants [voces?] and immediate rights, possessions or authorities, which I have or should have, and men or women have or should have through me by fiefs, or by alods, or by bailiwicks, or agreements or surrenders, or by writs, or mourning, or tithe, or whatever rights in the county of Razes, Conserans, and Comminges,  and  Carcassonne, and Narbonne, and Port-Vendres, and Toulouse, as all the said were of Roger count of old Carcassone, and Odo his brother count of Razès, and Bernard-Roger, and as they were of count Peter Raymond my husband, and Roger my son, as much as the above held or had in whatever way there, and men and women through them.   For all the above, cities, counties, bishoprics, viscounties, and others honors and dignities, towns or castles, fortifications or fortresses, churches, parishes, townships, homes, rents, revenues, markets, tolls, freight fees , travel fees, fairs [?firae] lime-kilns [?raffegae], lodgings, pasture-lands, woods,  oak-woods, trees, gardens, cultivated or deserted, mountains and estates, stones and coins, in circulation or not, rustic and urban, moot or assembly. meadows or pastures, fountains, rivers with their runoffs, and fisheries and mills or mill-works, or with all lands or vineyards, cultivated or deserted, roads with their lead-ins or lead-outs, or with all abbeys, monasteries, cells, possessions, shares and alods, or their chapels with all their boundaries and appurtenances which are, were, or will be in said counties, bishoprics or viscounties.  All the above came to me, above-inscribed Rangard, through  and immediate rights, or agreements or surrenders, through written will made to me from said man my husband or spouse or through my tithe, or through hereditary mourning, of my said son count Roger, or through whatever warrants or authorities.  All the aforesaid written above with all their boundaries and appurtenances and their limits, I said countess Rangard by my willing spirit and pleasure, without force and fear and power, freely and solidly and wholly, and without any restraint, I sell without deception to you said lord Raymund, that is count, and countess Almodis and your son Raymond-Berengar for the price of four-hundred ounces of pure and best gold weighed at legal weight, which price you aforesaid gave me and I received from you and nothing of that price remained with you the buyers to be paid, and that is manifest.   All of which indeed I said countess Rangard together with that town of Couffoulens with its boundaries and appurtenances, or with that town of Razès, and with that town of Ventagion, and with that town of Capendu and with that town of Peyriac, with its boundaries and churches and all its appurtenances, similarly with that of Auriac with its boundaries and appurtenances, similarly with all those fortresses and possessions, townships, and rents and revenues and travel-fees, and coins, and inns, and statics, and assemblies, and battlements  and justices, and redirections, similarly with all the retainments which I said Rangard now acquired in all the above, had or retained in any way, or ought to have or retain, and men or women have or retain or ought to have or retain or ought to have had through me in any way, by my right I hand over to your lordship and power, etc.  This writing of sale was done on the tenth kalends of May [sic], in the 11th year of the reign of king Phillip.  S[ign] of countess Rangard who confirmed  this and asked it to be confirmed.  I, Peter, priest, who wrote the document of this bestowal as asked and subscribed it on the above-noted day and year.
