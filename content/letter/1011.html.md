<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To abbess Theutberg for the regulation of the monastery of Avennay, which she had once determined with queen Ermintrude, about the number of clerics and nuns and the possessions of the towns of that monastery, namely a thousand one hundred fifty manses(1); signifying that he had arranged for it to be able to have twenty clerics and forty nuns there, and provided food for them and necessities and established ministers besides lights and the other necessities of the monastery; showing that Nivard the archbishop of Reims constructed the monastery of Hautville from possessions of the church of Reims, and his brother from his properties/possessions and what other good men gave to that place built the monastery of Avennay, which he handed over to the church of Reims, for which they had charters openly showing that; but through a royal gift, as other things of this church were held from a long time back by outsiders.  Et cetera.

Et cetera.
