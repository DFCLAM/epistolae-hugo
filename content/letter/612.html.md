<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Grant to Peter Chacepork of the treasureship of the church of Lincoln and the prebend of the said church, late of Ralph, treasurer of Lincoln, deceased, in the king’s gift by reason of the voidance of the see; with mandate in pursuance to the dean and chapter of Lincoln.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
<h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2>Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry III, 1247-58, 4.366; summary in English.(1)
<h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>03/22/1254
