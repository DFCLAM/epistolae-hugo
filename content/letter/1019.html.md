<h2> Translated letter:</h2>If we defend what are ours with the power of God more than of the Gaetan, and are not deeply lacking in them, indeed constructing cutters with other boats and other vessels and apparatus of war, why not rather prepare the souls of men, arming them incessantly against hostile incursions
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Siquidem cum virtute Dei melius quam Kaietani, que nostra sunt, defendemus et illorum in nullo penitus indigemus, dromones scilicet cum ceteris navibus construentes et cetera vasa bellica et apparatus, quin potius et ipsos animos hominum preparantes et adversus hostiles incursus indesinenter armantes.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>It is difficult to know exactly what John is asking for  here, but presumably help against Saracen (and/or Christian) attacks.
