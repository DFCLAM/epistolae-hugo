<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth, by the grace of God queen of Hungary, to her faithful in the chapter of Buda, greetings and grace.&nbsp; You will/should know that the sisters of the island of the glorious Virgin, for certain possessions of theirs called Belch, Ráksi and Dada, should show what they have to us in fifteen days from the Feast of the Holy King; but because of the dangers of the roads they do not dare to bring those charters in their [original] form (<i>specie</i>) to our court; we command, ordering your loyalty:&nbsp; that you write back to us the content as they showed it to you of their charter on their possessions, under your seal, not to be done otherwise.&nbsp; Dated in Pastuh, on the day after the Assumption of the Glorious Virgin.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth, Dei gratia, regina Hungariae, fidelibus suis Capitulo Budensi salutem et gratiam.&nbsp; Noueritis, quod sorores de insula Virginis gloriosae, super quibusdam possessionibus earum, Belch, Rakussi et Dada, vocatis, sua debent in quindenis S.
