<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Mandate to the tenants of the honours of Kermerdin and Cardigan to do their homages and fealties to Edward the king’s son, to whom the king has given by charter the said castles and towns with the honours; saving to the king their allegiance to him.
By the queen.
The like to the barons of Mayronnyth and all the other Welsh tenants of the honour of Kermerdin and Cardigan.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
