<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the Lord.&nbsp; I Roger, count of Foix and my brothers, Peter and Raymond make an agreement with you Bernard-Ato viscount and your wife Cecilia viscountess and your sons Roger and Raymond Trencavel and Bernard and their posterity on the whole honor which we have and ought to have in the county of Toulouse and in Comminges and in Coseran and in Carcassonne and in all their boundaries, that we cannot give or sell or mortgage anything of all the said honors or transfer the power in any way to another except to you or by your counsel.&nbsp; If indeed we should have children from a legally married wife, &nbsp;they would have and hold and possess our said honors and all children would similarly hold said agreements with you and your children and their posterity for all the said honors which we have and ought to have in the county of Carcassonne and Toulouse and Comminges and in Coseran and all their boundaries, and castles, towns, churches, abbeys with all their honors, rustic and urban places, cultivated and uncultivated, woods, unworked lands, pastures, waters, acqueducts and drains, and roads and everything in all of them.&nbsp; If indeed children&nbsp; from our legally wed wife should not survive, we give to you and your children those said honors after our death,that is Foix and Frédelas and Lordat and Castellane-pendent and that castle of Dun and the castle of Mirepoix and all the others castles and towns and honors that we have and ought to have in said counties.&nbsp; And so let this charter remain firm and stable for all time, which was made on 2 kalends of April, Tuesday after Easter, in the year 1125 of the lord’s Incarnation, in the reign of king Louis.&nbsp; Sign of count Roger and his brothers Peter and Raymond who thus confirmed this charter.&nbsp; Sign of Bernard of Durban, etc., as in the preceding act [490.1].</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>In nomine Domini.
