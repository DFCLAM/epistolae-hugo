<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Since I, Ralph/Raoul, by divine mercy count of Amiens, pursuing the glory of secular dignity, knew that I was weighed down by a great load of sins, I granted to the church of holy Mary mother of God and the most blessed martyr Fermin and the brothers established there, certain things which were within my right to hand over, so that I might obtain indulgence for my sins by their intervention.&nbsp; But since from the many things that I possessed bishop Guido took care to relax the most beneficial power that viscounts exercized in the lands of said brothers, with his entreaty and grace, I granted them by perpetual right to have whatever of that kind pertaining to the castle of Conty that I and the knights of that honor of Conty obtained of their lands and towns.&nbsp; And so that the granting of this donation may last firm and indissoluble, my son Simon and Walter, son of Walter of Tirell. voluntarily offered their consent to this document and the noted knights, praising it, received from me equivalent fiefs for those they had lost.&nbsp; And this charter, with my hand and that of my wife Anne, and my son Simon and the foresaid Walter, placed on the altar of blessed Mary, as prescribed form demands, bishop Guido anathematized all who tried to oppose by any attack what we have given to the church.&nbsp;</p><p>The names of clerics and laymen who were present at this deed we ordered subscribed at the end.&nbsp;
