<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I, Marie, Duchess of Burgundy, make known and testify that my Lord Duke Odo, in his last illness left to the church of St. Stephen, his spiritual mother, all that he had at some time unjustly denied it by right:&nbsp; hence when I was in charge of the Duchy after his death, and went to Argilly, I purposely inquired into the truth of a certain right which the church of St. Stephen of&nbsp; Dijon said it had in the property of that town and I recognized clearly that it has two free allods there with their appurtenances, one at Argilly, the other at Prefergoil, and therefore the church or the inhabitants of their estate [praediorem] ought to have free usage in the pastures, waters, and woods of that property, in this way, that they can cut down and carry away for timber or burning and all necessities, but they cannot cut them down to sell or give the wood, nor can they carry them outside the property without permission of the foresters.&nbsp; That church can also send there one hundred one pigs, who will have free-run through the whole estate without payment for pasturage and brush [?ramalagio], which could also be a draw for foreign pigs, for which it will give half the pasturage-payment and will retain half; the pigs on the other hand will stay in one of the above-named places or in both, unless with the permission of the foresters they should stay elsewhere more conveniently; if the sows give birth there and nurse for a while, nothing will be exacted for the pigs following their mother. &nbsp;To the foresters, on the other hand, will be given each year at Dijon after the feast of All Saints sixty sesters of wine if they ask for it, and the minister of the Canons, who comes for the pasturage-payment with the ministers of the Duke, will give them a sester of wine; and if there should be one on foot, he will give a sester of wheat in the Argilly measure.&nbsp;</p><p>I, also, sollicitous of the salvation of the soul of my lord Duke, with Hugo my son grant and confirm this right as it is recognized and is written here,&nbsp; in perpetuity to the church of St. Stephen of Dijon.&nbsp; There were many present at this acknowledgment:&nbsp; Master John, cantor of that church, whose father is named Lebaudus, conferred this benefit on the church for his soul; Master Humbert, chaplain of the Duke; Master Richard and Lord Nicolas, our clerks; William of Orgoil, knight of Dijon; Wido de Solio and his brother Henry, knights of Argilly; Hugh, townsman; Bonietus and Minox, our vassals from Argilly; Peter, forester of that town; Anselm and Lambert from our court. &nbsp;And all these were recorded and acknowledged in our presence at Argilly and not much later at Dijon, at which [later] acknowledgment were present Lord Gislebert, venerable Abbot of St. Stephen of Dijon; and his brother Lord Josbert of Grancey; and aforesaid Master John; and lord Arvey of Faverney, canon; Henry, chaplain of Chenavis; the aforesaid Willerm [sic], Henry of Castellione and Goodfriend, burgher of Dijon, and many others.&nbsp; These were enacted in the 1162nd year from the Incarnation of the Lord,&nbsp; in which year the lord Duke Odo died.&nbsp; [Here] hangs the greater seal of Duchess Marie.<i></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego Maria Ducissa Burgundiae notum facio &amp; testificor quod Dominus meus Odo Dux in ultima aegritudine reliquit Ecclesiae S.
