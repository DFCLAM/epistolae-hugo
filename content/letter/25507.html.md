<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>This is the agreement which Raymond viscount by cognomen Trencavel and viscountess Ermengard his spouse made with Raymond count of Barcelona and countess Almodis and Raymond Berengar their son. The viscount and viscountess agreed with the aforesaid that those abbeys namely St. John of Valseguier and St. Peter of Caunes with their appurtenances, which they have in fief from said count and countess and their son for service to them, they may not sell, alienate, encumber, nor give to any man or woman from this day forward, except to said count of Barcelona and abovenamed countess, or their sons or daughters, or the monk sent there in God’s service , except encumbrances to them or gifts which were made to said abbeys, and except that obligation that occurred through said encumbrances or donations, directly to those successors of those holding said donations; but these abbeys many remain, except for said encumbrances and their said obligation, as they existed on that day when Raymond-Stephen of Servian and Arnal-William of Sauvian set themselves in hostage for said count and countess and their sons at Girona; and let this be done without deception.&nbsp; And if the said viscount and viscountess should die without male child from him or from her, said abbeys would wholly and freely revert to the power of said count of Barcelona and countess Almodis and their sons or daughters, except that fief which was held by Ato the Old, viscount of Ambialet.&nbsp; And if said viscount and viscountess should have a male son, he from his wife or she from her husband, [he] would have a similar agreement with the sons or daughters of said count and countess about said abbeys without any deception on their part.&nbsp; And said viscount and viscountess may not make castles or fortifications in said abbeys nor in their appurtenances, not they nor men or women by their counsel or artifice.&nbsp;</p><p>Also said viscount and viscountess agree to said count and countess and their son that they will not disrupt nor breach nor in any way withdraw, not they nor anyone by their counsel or artifice, that sale and removal and approval from said count and countess and their sons all the days of their lives which said viscount and viscountess made with them by the document of sale, determination or removal with all powers and rights which they had or ought to have and men and women through them in the county of Razès and Couserans and Comminges and Carcassonne and Narbonne and Minerve and Toulouse, as this document made by us contains them.&nbsp; And said viscount and viscountess, so they may hold all these documents faithfully and attend to said count and countess and their abovenamed son, send into their power as hostage Raymond-Stephen of Servian and Arnal-William of Sauvian, and Alcher of Corneilhan and Guitard Lupo of Guéret (Guerris), and William-Peter of Guéret, and Peter-Sicard and Aldemar-Rostaing, in such a way that if said viscount and viscountess should disrupt or breach the above-written sale or removal or approval or agreement by themselves or other men or women through their counsel or artifice, within the first twenty days after said count or countess or their son or men for them they would call on all those said hostages, or one or two of them, to make amends for that wrong without deception to said count and countess and their son and their plaintiffs.&nbsp; And if this were not amended within the first twenty days, as written above, all the said hostages would revert to the power of said count and countess of Barcelona and their son Raymond, either in the city of Carcassonne or in the <em>castrum</em> of Saissac or the <em>castrum</em> of Laurac, or the <em>castrum</em> of Razès or in one of thse <em>castris</em> to which they had been called and where they would revert, and this should be done within the other first ten days without deception, and they would not leave there without permission and will of said count and countess and their son, similarly, as is written above in that hostageship with their confirmation.&nbsp;</p><p>And these hostages may not prevent themselves from being called upon. &nbsp;He or they who call upon them may not derive payment from it and said hostages may have said viscount and viscountess if they did not wish to amend that harm, satisfy by oath and battle through one horseman who had never done sworn battle with shield and club, that he had not committed that harm, nor he who had done it did not do it by their counsel or artifice, nor do it to disrupt said sale or agreement .&nbsp; And if the horseman of said viscount and viscountess were conquered, he would amend that injury doubly, together with that injury from that horseman that accepted that battle and what the count and countess gave to that horseman for that battle.&nbsp; And if the horseman of said count and countess were conquered, they would put an end to that harm and make amends to said viscount and viscountess and their horseman for those injuries he had received in that battle and what said viscount and viscountess gave him for that battle; and this battle should take place&nbsp; in the county of Carcassonne with the approval of four good men whom they choose on both sides, who would make a resolution and peace without deception.&nbsp; And if any of said hostages should die, said viscount and viscountess would send another hostage or other no less worthy men into the power of said count and countess and their son in place of the dead men or man within the first ten days after they had been called upon.&nbsp; If those who replaced them were to die, they would be assiduously replaced and others from said viscount and viscountess as long as they lived.&nbsp; If they did not, said hostages or those sent in their place would fall into the power of said count and countess and their sons.&nbsp; This was enacted on 5 kalends of July, in the 11th year of the reign of king Philip.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Hec est conveniencia quam faciunt Raimundus, vicecomes, cognomento trencavells et Ermengardis, vicecomitisse, et Raimundo Berengarii, illorum filio.&nbsp;
