<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To the excellent lady A, countess of Leicester, brother Adam [sends] greetings and praiseworthy outcomes of salutary counsels.</p><p>Touched within by sorrow of the heart, and suffused without by redness of face, I have already for several days heard not trivially about the numerous dishonorable harms of rumor over the unseemly dishonors of your state, which an embittered mind does not cease to bewail, not undeservedly.&nbsp; For which reason, from contemplation of the Saviour who since he is the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation, does not throw out one coming to him, to whom it is said, “Have mercy on all, since you can [do] all things, and neglect the sins of men for repentance, spare all those which are yours, Lord, who love souls.”&nbsp; I ask, admonish, and beg that for the rest, doing good with multiple increments of honest [deeds] you strive to clear your conscience before the Highest and reform the opinion among men, in all ways that touch on your husband and your children, your household and those close to you, together; presenting yourself constantly, vigilantly, reasonably, and peacefully, according to the examples of praiseworthy matrons.&nbsp; It should be known that I, with your other friends, will labor indefatigably according to what would please the Divinity and will seem expeditious, for your salvation and equally your honor, while your benignity wishes to consent to this urging, rather to the divine command, with its outcome.&nbsp; Be well.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Excellenti dominae A., Comitissae Leycestriae, Frater Ada salutem et laudabiles consiliorum salubrium effectus.</p><p>Tactus dolore cordis intrinsecus, et foris faciei rubore suffusus, jam a diebus pluribus inhonestioribus famae crebrescentibus molestiis, super dedecentiis statum vestram maculantibus non mediocriter audivi, quae mens amaricata nec immerito plangere non cessat. Quamobrem ob contemplationem Salvatoris, qui cum sit Pater misericordiarum et Deus totius consolationis, venientem ad se non ejicit foras, cui dictum est, " Misereris omnium, quia omnia potes, et dissimulas peccata hominum propter poenitentiam, parcis autem omnibus quae tua sunt, Domine, qui amas animas " rogo, moneo, et adjuro, ut de caetero benefacientes multiplicibus honestatum incrementis, et conscientiam serenare coram Altissimo, et ad homines opinionem reformare studeatis, modis omnibus in iis quae virum vestrum, et liberos vestros, familiam vestram, et communiter proximos vestros contingunt; vigilanter, rationabiliter, et pacifice, secundum exempla matronarum laudabilium vosmetipsas jugiter exhibentes. Sciturae quod ego, cum caeteris amicis vestris, secundum quod Divinitati placuerit et expedire videbitur, indefesse laborabo ad salu­tem vestram pariter et honorem, dum tamen huic suasioni, immo praeceptioni divinae consentire vestra benignitas voluerit cum effectu. Valete.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>Another letter of admonishment, but no indication what it refers to.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Adae de Marisco Epistolae</i>, ed.
