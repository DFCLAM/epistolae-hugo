Notum sit omnibus tam presentibus quam futuris quod Robertus, comes Flandrensis, et ego Clementia, eius uxor, pro remedio animarum nostrarum ecclesiam quamdam apud Falmontem constituimus, dedimus atque huic ecclesie ad usus monialium ibidem Deo servientium decimas de nova terra que a modo usque in sempiternum succreverit, et de veteri terra decimam lini, quam dominus meus R(obertus), comes, ad usus meos dederat, predicte ecclesie concessimus, et de nova terra duodecim bonarios similiter concessimus. Deinde, defuncto comite Roberto bone memorie viro, assensu et concessione filii mei, comitis Balduini et Caroli, comitis, qui post eum regnavit, et comitis Theodorici, omnia que predicta ecclesia obtinuit, testimonio baronum nostrorum eidem concessimus, quorum nomina subscribuntur: &nbsp;S. Wilelmi, nepotis comitis; S. Iwani de Gant; S. Henrici de Broburc; S. Rogeri, castellani de Insula; S. Roberti, filii eius; S. Balduini, dapiferi de Henin; S. Danielis de Tenremonde; S. Hugonis de Aqua; S. Oliveri de Bunduis; S. Tebaldo de Vitriaco; S. Balduini, castellani de Lens; S. Goscewini de Nova Ecclesia; S. Stephani, dapiferi; S. Almorici de Landast; S. Walteri, castellani de Duaco; S. Roberti, prepositi; S. Godefridi de Balmeis. Et in presentia predictorum diffinitum fuit quod de terra et de bonis meis pro amore Dei michi licitum esset dare. Preterea terram quamdam quam Galterus de Rasca, castellanus de Duaco, obtinebat cum terra de Alno, michi reddidit et eam libere sine aliqua contradictione, assensu predicti Galteri, ecclesie possidendam tradidi. Hanc vero terram tenent de ecclesia scilicet Galterus, et Lietaldus et Stephanus et Iohannes, fratres eius. Unum quoque bonarium de terra Manieri, et&nbsp;terram cuiusdam mulieris Angligene, ecclesie concessimus. Volumus etiam ut notum sit omnibus quod Robertus Galgau, serviens meus, tres bonarios de terra sua et duos hospites quos de me in feodo&nbsp;tenebat, michi absque ulla contradictione reddidit, et ipse sanus et alacer corpore, me rogavit ut illam terram et illos hospites tali condicione ecclesie daremus ut inde in festo sancii Remigii sex solidos, et in Natali Domini très solidos et très capones, et tres denariatas panis eadem ecclesia haberet. Quod, sicut predictus Hubertus me rogavit, constitui, hiis astantibus: Stephano, dapifero; Gaitero, castellano; Gerardo et Godino, fratribus suis; Amalrico de Landast; Stephano, fratri suo; Rogero. Innotescat itidem omnibus fidelibus quod Imbertus decimam duodecim bonariorum terre que habebat in feodo de domina Elissenda, castellana, eius assensu et filii sui, Godefridi, castellani, et insuper domine Clementie, comitisse, predicte ecclesie perpetuo iure possidendam donavit. Amalricus etiam decimam sex bonariorum terre quam de domino Godefrido, castellano, tenebat, assensu eius et domine C(lementie) comitisse, sepedicte ecclesie pro salute anime fratris sui Ledberti possidendam tribuit. Simul etiam Simon de Humengges homo abbatisse effectus est, et fidelitatem ecclesie cum iureiurando omni tempore vite sue servaturum promisit. Heimericus, clericus, domos quas edificaverat, et nemus quod possidebat in terra sancte Marie Casletuli, uxore sua Manisinde favente, sepiusdicte ecclesie concessit. Cuius rei viri testes subscribuntur: Hugo, dapifer, et fratres eius Gerardus, Stephanus, Anselmus; Godefridus, castellanus; domina Elisendis; Walterus, filius eius; Gerardus de Campis; Seggo; Godinus; Stephanus et Amalricus de Landast; Rodgerus de Helemeis; Walterus, frater eius; Hugo Gallus de Costices; Iordains de Campis; Thomas et Reinbaldus, fratres eius; Walterus, villicus; Nicolaus de Halli; Odo et filius eius, Iohannes.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The countess recalls gifts she and her deceased husband made to Faumont when they founded it and adds new gifts which she made with the consent of Robert’s three successor counts and which some of her vassals made with her consent. Adair suggests that Clementia focused on Faumont late in her life because Bourbourg was difficult for her to get to after she lost her coastal towns, 282.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Un cartulaire de l’abbaye de Notre Dame de Bourbourg</i>, ed.
