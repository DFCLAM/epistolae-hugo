<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God senior/dowager queen of Hungary to all to whom the presents are shown, greetings in the lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wish to bring to the notice of all by the contents of the presents that though we ordered the tithes of the free towns of Veröce and Lipova and the whole county of Veröce, of fruits, wine, marten fur, tributes,&nbsp; markets and ports in our time believing those tithes to pertain to us, though we were also often asked by the venerable father Timothy by the grace of God bishop of Zagreb for restitution, we did not acquiesce until now in this regard.&nbsp; But since the truth was sought diligently and appeared in a clearer light in every way to us as much through religious men and other ecclesiastics, as through major trustworthy laymen with every exception, that those tithes truly and without doubt pertain to the right and property of said venerable father Timothy, bishop of Zagreb and his church.&nbsp; Wishing to consult our conscience and salvation, we have given back and restored purely and simply without any opposition in full right those tithes, namely fruits, wine, marten-fur, tributes, markets, and ports of the said towns and the whole county of Veröce to said venerable father Timothy bishop of Zagreb, to his successors and to his church.&nbsp; Leaving behind and permitting him to receive said tithes without opposition peacefully and quietly.&nbsp; Promising moreover in good faith that from now on we shall not trouble said lord bishop and his successors and the church of Zagreb over those tithes nor shall we permit them to be troubled by anyone.&nbsp; And that this our owed and salutary restitution of tithes to said venerable father Timothy bishop of Zagreb and his successors and the church of Zagreb made by us may remain perpetual, undisturbed and inviolable, we promise to obtain letters from our dearest son Ladislaus by the grace of God illustrious king of Hungary and his consort, our beloved daughter-in-law, for the lord bishop and his church to give action on the firmness and stability of the prescriptions with all sincerity of spirit in good faith.&nbsp; In perpetual and stable memory of which thing we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated in Veröce, on the octave of St. Martin the confessor, in the thousand two hundred eighty third year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth dei gracia maior regina Hungarie vniuersis quibus presentes ostendentur salutem in domino.&nbsp;
