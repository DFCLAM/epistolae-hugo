<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Mandate to queen Eleanor to cause to be assigned to the said earl [of Cornwall] out of the first escheats which fall in the realm, to the amount of 500L. of land yearly, which the king granted to him in frank marriage with Senchia his wife; lands already assigned to him being reckoned towards this amount.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When he left to deal with a rebellion in Gascony, Henry left the government of England in the hands of Eleanor, with the counsel of his brother, Richard of Cornwall.  It was, therefore, up to her to see that his promises to his brother who had married the queen's sister were honored.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
<h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><em>Calendar of the Patent Rolls, Henry III, 1247-58</em>, 4.204; summary in English.(1)</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1253, July?
