<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>I Amat, son of the woman Ermengard, swear that from this hour forward I shall be faithful to you, countess Elizabeth, without fraud and evil contrivance and without any deception or trickery, as a faithful man should be to his lord, by rightful faith, as far as I know.&nbsp; And I the aforesaid Amat shall not refuse you, said Elizabeth, that castle of Barcelona, Novo, which I hold, not I, any man or men, woman or women, by my counsel or by my contrivance, and as often as you should ask me for it by your messengers or messenger, I would give you power over it without trickery.&nbsp; And if there were a man or men, woman or women, who would take said castle from you, Elizabeth, or refuse it to you, I said Amat shall not have peace or truce or any associations with them (male and female) or him or her until you have recovered it; and I shall be an aid to you so far until you have recovered said castle.&nbsp; And I shall not deceive you in this oath, nor harm you, but as is written above, so I shall fulfil it with righteous faith.&nbsp; As is written above so I shall hold and keep it.&nbsp; By God and the relics of these saints.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Iuro ego Amatus, filius de Ermengardis, femina, quod de ista hora in antea fidelis ero ad te, Helisabet, comitissa, sine fraude et malo ingenio et sine ulla decepcione vel sine tuo engan, sicut fidelis homo debet esse suo seniori, me sciente, per directam fidem.&nbsp; Et ego suprascriptus Amatus no devedare ad te, Elisabeth iam dicta, ipsum castrum de Barchinona Novum quod ego teneo, nec ego, homo vel homines, femina vel feminas, per meum consilium nec per meum ingenium, et per quantas vices lo m demanaras per te ipsam vel per tuos missos vel missum, pudestadiva t en fare sine tuo engan.&nbsp; Et si fuerit homo vel homines, femina vel feminas, qui tollant ad te, Elisabeth, iam dictum castrum aut tibi eum devetent, ego iam dictus Amatus finem neque treguam neque societatem cum eis [vel] cum eo sive cum illas vel cum illa non habuero donec tu recuperatum habeas; et tantum de hac causa adiutor tibi ero donec recuperatum habeas iam dictum castrum.&nbsp; Et de isto sacramento no t enganare, ne mal te n menare, sed sicut superius scriptum est, ita adiempleam recta fide.&nbsp; Sicut superius scriptum est, si o tenre [et] o atendre.&nbsp; Per Deum et istarum sanctarum reliquiarum.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>Amat swears an oath to the countess for Novo, a town in Barcelona countess.&nbsp; It is not clear how this oath relates to the one taken by Oliba Mir for the same town, presumably one succeeds and supercedes the other.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Liber Feudorum Maior</i> (LFM), ed.
