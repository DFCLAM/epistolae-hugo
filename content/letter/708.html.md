<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Love, by which I am captured too late
	has taught me, by his domination,
	sweet lady, about paradise,
	so I would sing a song about you.
	For the joy that can last
	one should serve and love you.
	And because no one has so transgressed
	against your son, in deeds or words,
	if he has enrolled in your service
	do not have that remembered.
	For the joy that can last
	one should serve and love you.
	Virgin queen, lily flower,
	what delights man has,
	who is seized with love for you,
	no one could recount.
	For the joy that can last
	one should serve and love you.
	That vessel was very well chosen,
	Sweet Lady, where the Holy Spirit
	was nourished for nine whole months:
	that was your heart, Lady without peer!
	For the joy that can last
	one should serve and love you.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>Amours, ou trop tart me sui pris
	M’a, par sa signourie, apris,
	Douce dame de paradis
	Ke de vous voeill un cant canter.
	Pour la joie ki puet durer
	Vous doit on servir et amer.
	Et pou çou ke nus n’a mespris
	Tant vers vo fill, n’en fais, n’en dis,
	S’il s’est en vo service mis,
	Ke vous nel faciés racorder.
	Pour la joie ki puet durer
	Vous doit on servir et amer.
	Virge Roine, flour de lis,
	Com li hom a de ses delis
	Ki de vous amer est espris,
	Nus hom nel saroit reconter.
	Pour la joie ke puet durer
	Vous doit on servir et amer.
	Mout fu li vaissiaus bien eslis,
	Douce Dame, ou Sains esp(e)ris
	Fu .ix. mois tous entiers nouris:
	Ce fu vos cuers, Dame sans per!
	Pour la joie ki puet durer
	Vous doit on servir et amer.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>This is a religious poem attributed to the queen in the rubric of the MS in which it occurs.  It may or may not be hers.
The queen is also named as the recipient, perhaps the other party in a debate (jeu-parti) with the king of Navarre, “Dame merci une rien vous demant,” in one of the manuscripts (Chansonnier du Vatican), Maillard, 68, but that attribution has been questioned.
