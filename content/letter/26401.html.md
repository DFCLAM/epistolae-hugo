<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p><span>I, Alix, mother of the duke of Burgundy, make known to all who will see the present letters that Walter of Dijon and his wife Maria, standing in my presence, for the salvation of their souls, gave in alms and conceded to the church of Lieu-Dieu two measures of vineyard situated in the territory of Nuits, which is called Proulle, of which two they had bought one from the Moretz, the other from Genevois; and it should be known that said Walter and Maria held those two pieces of vineyard for their lifetime so that they could not sell or mortgage it, but rather after their death the said measures of vineyard would revert freely and without burden of debt to said church of Lieu-Dieu. In witness of which at the entreaties of said Walter and Marie, I have sealed the present letters with my seal. Enacted in his 1240th year of the Lord in the month of July.</span></p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ego Alaydis, mater ducis Burgundie, notum facio omnibus presentes litteras inspecturis quod Galterus de Divione et Maria, uxor sua, in presentia mea constituti, pro remedio animarum suarum ecclesie Loci Dei dederunt in elemosinam et concesserunt duas pecias vinee sitas in finagio de Nuiz, quod vocatur Pruulle, quarum peciarum unam emerunt des Moretez et alteram dou Genevois; et sciendum quod dicti Galterus et Maria, duas supradictas pecias vinee ad vitam suam tenebant, ita tamen quod vendere vel invadiare non poterunt, imo post decessum ipsorum ad dictam ecclesiam Loci Dei predicte pecie vinee libere et sine onere debitorum revertentur.&nbsp; In cujus rei testimonium ad preces dictorum Galteri et Marie presentes litteras sigillo meo sigillavi.&nbsp; Actum est hoc anno Domini MoCCoXL, mense julio.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The duchess makes known a donation made to the nuns of Lieu-Dieu.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>E.
