<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, mother of the duke of Burgundy, make known to present and future that when there was a disagreement between Peter Cementary and his wife Marie, our people, on one side, and the venerable abbot and convent of Saint-Seine on the other, over what said P. and M. sought from said abbot and convent, the whole bordage at Turcey of Hugo of Turcey, formerly dean of Saint-Seine, moveables as well as immoveables, they promised to abide in all matters by the arbitration of  these, namely the lord Arnulph of Lantenay, curate of Troalet, master Jacob, curate of Mont Bellardin, Guy, knight of Maulain, and Addo Masquelin, townsman of Dijon, under penalty of twenty pounds and with an oath that they would abide by the arbitration in peace or by the judgment of those who having heard arguments and confessions of both sides and received testimony produced on the part of the church of Saint-Seine, and according to the ancient customs of Turcey and the land of Saint-Seine.  Judging in all things with the order of right preserved, said arbiters pronounced from the confession of  prudent men against Peter Cementary and Maria, his wife, that they had no right to the said things nor could they restore one, and they adjudged all the above to the church of Saint-Seine to be possessed quietly and peacefully in perpetuity , and said P. and Maria swore to hold this fixed as it was judged in perpetuity and to observe it faithfully.  In witness of which I have strengthened the present charter with the protection of my seal.  Enacted in the year 1238 in the month of July.
