<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and future who will look at the present writing, greetings in the bestower of salvation.&nbsp; Prudent reginal benevolence ought to weigh the loyalties and services of individuals not unjustly and respond, if not fully still to some extent, to those serving faithfully with worthy rewards of remuneration, so that others aroused by the example may be invited more easily to deeds of loyalty.&nbsp; Hence we wish to bring to the attention of all present and future by the contents of these, that we, considering the loyalties and merits of the services of the noble man Dominic, count/<i>ispán</i>, son of Peter of the Csák family, judge of our court, which he gave us tirelessly from the ardor of pure fidelity, in the exchange of his possessions of Muhi and Narag in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Vyuar, also those called Zeuleus, Stara and Prische in the county of Zemplén, which we handed over to others, with him giving it up at the pleasure of our will; also for the shedding of his blood for us when certain traitors inhabitants of our kingdom at Alba rising up with armed hands before the time of the coronation of our dearest son king Ladislas against our excellence.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ripping the sword from the hand of a certain armed man who had rushed into the home of our majesty with reckless boldness, he might have risked death, if the hands of other armed criminals had not been hindered; he received a lethal wound and being left there half alive barely recovered health with the lord granting.&nbsp; We gave the possession called Hagamas beside the Danube, where the Drava river falls into the Danube, in the county of Valkó, with all its appendages, circumstances, uses, appurtenances, namely woods, vineyards, meadows, hayfields, fishponds, tribute established both in the river Drava and in the Danube, and in all those appurtainng to the village Hagmas by whatever name they are assessed; we gave, conferred, granted, handed over, and donated [these] to that count Dominic, our faithful, with the agreement, consent and will of our dearest son the king and all our barons, though small as compensation for his possessions, which we took from him, and the shedding of his blood for us, and of his services and loyalties, [we gave] to him and his heirs, and successors of his heirs to be possessed by perpetual right peacefully and irrevocably.&nbsp; That the content of this donation of ours may remain always secure and unimpaired, and cannot be withdrawn in the course of time by anyone as invalid, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Philip, by the grace of God bishop of Vaciens, chancellor of our court, our faithful, in the thousand two hundred seventy third year from the incarnation of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabet dei gracia regina Hungarie universis Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam futuris presens scriptum inspecturis salutem in salutis largitore.&nbsp; Circumspecta reginalis benignitas debet non immerito pensare fidelitates et servicia singulorum et si non plene tamen aliqualiter sibi fideliter servientibus dignis remuneracionum premiis respondere;
