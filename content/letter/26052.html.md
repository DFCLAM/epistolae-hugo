<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Ivo, by the grace of God bishop of Chartres, to Matilda viscountess of Blois, greetings.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we ought to give helpful warnings and instructions to you and all whom we love in God or because of God, we warn and instruct by Christian law that you put off the marriage you have determined to enter with the count of Vendôme until [there has been] legitimate discussion/investigation, so that you do not lose the good reputation you have so far had.&nbsp; For people related to the count of Vendôme and your husband Robert speak of consanguinity, in the degree in which the letters sent to the count show and they are prepared to prove them.&nbsp; About which I set a day and place for you and the count to send me your messengers about this.&nbsp; The order of relationship is written above [in the letter to the count].&nbsp; Hail.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ivo, Dei gratia humilis Ecclesiae Carnotensis episcopus, Mathildi Belesensi vicecomitissae, salutem.</p><p>Quoniam &nbsp;tibi et omnibus quos in Deum vel propter Deum diligimus, salubria monita vel praecepta dare debemus, monemus et praecipimus per legem Christianam, ut conjugium quod cum comite Vindocinensi te inituram &nbsp;pepigisti, usque ad legitimam discussionem differas, et bonam aestimationem quam hactenus habuisti non amittas [al.perdas].&nbsp; Quod si aliter praesumpseris, et excommunicationi subjacebis, et perdes res tuas quas pro hoc conjugio distraxeris.&nbsp; Dicunt enim communes consanguinei Vindocinensis comitis, et Roberti vicecomitis mariti tui defuncti, quia consanguinei fuerunt comes Vindocinensis et Robertus maritus tuus, eo gradu quo litterae comiti missae demonstrant, et probare parati sunt.&nbsp; De qua re statuam tibi et comiti diem et locum, cum ad me propter hoc nuntios vestros miseritis.&nbsp; Ordo autem &nbsp;parentelae supra scriptus est [epist.129].&nbsp; Vale</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>Relatives of both the countess's deceased husband and her intended husband objected to the marriage on the grounds of consanguinity, which they outlined to the bishop as follows: &nbsp;Landric Sorus had a son and daughter, which son, Lancelin by name engendered a son Lancelin from whom came Agnes who gave birth to Robert, which Robert married the daughter of Hugo of Dunois.&nbsp; Bucard “Rata-pilata” married the daughter of Landric Sorus, from which came Bucard “the bald” from whom Fulc Aser was born, from whom descended Nifrana who gave birth to Geoffrey “grey mantle” who wishes to marry her (PL 162, c.140, ep.129). &nbsp;Ivo threatened excommunication but the marriage took place.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p>PL 162, c.140, ep.130.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Date:</h2>1102?
