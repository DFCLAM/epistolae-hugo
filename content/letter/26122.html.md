<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the holy and individual trinity.&nbsp; In the onethousand onehundredth year from the incarnation of the lord, indiction 8.&nbsp; M[atilda], what she is by the grace of God.&nbsp; While to the honor of God and of his pious mother Mary we formerly with our faithful had the care of the glorious triumph of the Pisan church and its duomo, begun with wondrous ornaments of stone (copings/mosaics?), we would turn daily &nbsp;in spirit with persistent intent of mind to how we might bring it about with worthy help, we granted, as much for our as for our mother’s soul resting there to complete the work of that church or some restoration perhaps after the work is done [8-9 letters missing], a field in the jurisdiction of the march next to the palace, whose head is bound in the south by the river Arno, a second side running from the highway to the east, a third the land of Baruncellus, the fourth the land of the march, in such a way that the field should be inhabited and the pension of the inhabitants and the payment of any honor ought similarly be paid and given to the construction or restoration work of the building.&nbsp; Over which we have reserved no other power in our right than when we happen to come to Pisa, without harm or any&nbsp; oppression of the inhabitants we might have hospitality there for us and our people; so that if anyone should presume to usurp or alienate the use from the work or restoration of the church to others than we have granted above by fief/fee or by writing or exchange or any pact, said field of our grant would revert to our jurisdiction and property of the march.&nbsp; Therefore we ask and we order that no one, duke, marquis, count, viscount, provost, and no small or great person should dare to harm or diminish the church further from this grant.&nbsp; If anyone, however, God forbid, should boldly attempt to break this document of our grant, he would pay the penalty of one hundred pounds of silver, half to said church, half to our chamber, and this writing would remain in force always.&nbsp; Which, that it may be believed more truly and held more firmly in future times by all, we have signed with the subscription of our own hand.<br>+ Matilda by the grace of God, what she is, I have subscribed.<br>I, Frugerius, chaplain by the order of this lady wrote the document of this grant under the witness of good men of Lombardy as well as Tuscany:&nbsp; Arduin, Godfrey, Raginer, and Gerard, viscounts, and Hugo son of Gandulf.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>In nomine sancte et individue trinitatis.&nbsp; Anno ab incarnatione domini millesimo CI, indictione VIII.&nbsp;
