<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Notification that the king has inspected a letter obligatory of Queen Eleanor to the abbot and convent of Certeseye upon a loan of 550 marks made to her by Ruccus Cambii, Luterius Benincas', Reyner Abbatis and their fellows, citizens and merchants of Florence, for which sum the abbot and convent are bound to the said merchants for her; and has confirmed the same, promising to save them harmless in respect of the same.

Eleanor's financial dealings are discussed in detail by Margaret Howell in "The Resources of Eleanor of Provence as Queen Consort," English Historical Review 102 (1987), 372-93.
