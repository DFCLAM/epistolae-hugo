<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I Joan, countess of Flanders and of Hainaut, make known to all both present and future that for the sake of divine love and at the requests of my dearest relative and faithful Sybil, lady of Wavre, I, as the higher lady, confirm the gift of parsonages from Houtawa and from New Temple with their appurtenances, which lord Rudolf of Rodes granted as perpetual alms to the church of blessed Andrew near Bruges, and the sales of portions of the tithe from Houtawa and the permission for tithes to be acquired in the aforesaid parsonages in exchange for her land or rents, as the lady herself of Wavre confirms in her letters, (and I) cause the present document to be strengthened by the affixing of my seal.
	Granted at Ypern, in the year of the Lord 1220, in the month of March.(1)
