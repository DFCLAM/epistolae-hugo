<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Alix, duchess of Burgundy, make known to all present and future, that the commune of Dijon swore at my order that if I married anyone except by the will of my dearest lord Philip, king of the Franks, or if I should not give the service I owe him, said commune, without misdeed, will hold itself to the lord King and will go against me, until there is satisfaction to the lord King, except for the customs and freedom of said commune.  That this be held fixed and firm, I have appended my seal to the present page.  Enacted in the one thousand two hundred eighteenth year of the Lord, in the month of August.

Quod ut ratum et firmum habeatur, presenti pagine sigillum meum apposui.  Actum anno Domini millesimo CCo octavo decimo, mense augusto.
