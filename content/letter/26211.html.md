<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Maria, by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will have notice of the presents greetings in the bestower of salvation.&nbsp; Since from diversity of times and change formerly [in] the county of Pozsega, our faithful <i>jobbágyok</i>* holding lands in that county were troubled over those lands and could not for a long time possess what they held legitimately in peace and quiet because of the machinations of challengers; their frequent supplication invited us to confirm the land of each of them by our charter.&nbsp; Indeed since it was not fully clear to us about the quantity and boundaries of their land, by which each was surrounded, we committed to the loyalty and diligence of our faithful Gyleth/Giletus&nbsp; ispán** of the <i>tavernicorum</i>*** of our illustrious lord king of Hungary and count of our <i>buchariorum</i>,*** so that going to each of their lands personally he might discover the quantity of those which they possessed from the time of Ugrin, archbishop of&nbsp; Kalocsa of bright memory, and since, and would look at the same time at their boundaries and let us know by his letters the status of the land with new erections beside old boundaries.&nbsp; Who having faithfully carried out our order and commission, sent us the lands and status of all said <i>jobbágyok</i> holding lands in said county from the time of said archbishop enclosed in a certain charter under his known and authentic seal; among which we found the land Beluch, Sewa and Otrochk, called Oryawicha land held by our faithful <i>jobbágyok</i> to be included under this status and these boundaries.</p><p>That first boundary of the land Beluch, Sewa and Otrochk begins in the east over a mountain where there is a land boundary and its coboundary is Bilotha, from which descending by that mountain into a path southward to a road, whence it goes to a pear tree, where the land boundary is and shares the boundary with said Bilota, then through certain bushes it goes directly to a certain embankment at the Oriawicha stream and from there crossing the river Oriawicha it goes to a sorb tree, where there is a land boundary, thence to a wood, crossing which wood it descends to a dry river in the west and there shares a boundary with Draas and from there ascends to a certain road beside which is a land boundary and there its shared boundary is said Draas, from which descending though a certain wood westward it goes to a tree which is call in the vernacular <i>nyrfa</i> and there is a land boundary and there the shared boundary is said Draas, from which it goes to boundaries of Demetrius’s widow’s land and then to the tree which is called <i>narfa </i>and there is a shared boundary with Demetrius’s widow’s land, from which it falls into an embankment which is called Birgnik creek and from there it descends eastward to a certain road up to the river Oriawcha, crossing which it goes east to an embankment and then ascending by a certain small part of the mountain it comes back to the first boundary and thus the boundaries of said land are fixed, which land we have confirmed under said boundaries, Beluch, Sewa and Otrochk, to our faithfuls and their heirs and successors of those heirs by the authority of the present charter in perpetual right under the observance, with duties and services and custom in all things and through all things, under which those holding land in Pozsega up to now have carried on.&nbsp; <br> Lest the content of this our confirmation should be weakened by anyone, in which a way of maligning by challengers is providently crushed, we have had the present charter strengthened by the defence of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated at Buda by the hand of our faithful master Ákos provost of Buda, chancellor of our court.&nbsp; In the onethousand two hundred fifty-eighth year of the lord, thirteenth kalends of February.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Maria dei gracia regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus presencium noticiam habituris salutem in salutis largitore.&nbsp;

CDCr 5.241-42).&nbsp; He identifies Giletus as <em>ispán</em> of the reginal butlers and the royal <em>tárnoks</em>, 64, and calls him <em>magister tavarnicorum</em> and <em>ispán</em> of the queen’s cup-bearers in relation to this land inquiry, 106.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2><p>*&nbsp;<i>Jobbágyok</i>&nbsp;designated the legally free tenant population living on private estates, by the late 13th century; originally they had been high ranking royal officers, according to Attila Zsoldos,&nbsp;<i>The Árpáds and Their Wives, Queenship in Early Medieval Hungary 1000-1301</i>&nbsp;(Rome:&nbsp; Viella, 2019), 208.</p><p>** Ispán refers to the head of an administrative and judicial unit, a county, Zsoldos, 207.</p><p>*** Zsoldos, 106, says the <i>magister tavernicorum</i> was responsible for queen’s revenue; &nbsp;since he also mentions cupbearers with a reference to this charter, 107, I assume that is the meaning of <i>burchariorum</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Codex diplomaticus regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae</i>, ed.
