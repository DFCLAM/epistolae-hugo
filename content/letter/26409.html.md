<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Since it is a pious lesson and from divine authority for those justly and reverently pondering&nbsp;the resurrection of the dead, to provide subsidies of alms for the sake of the relief and&nbsp;full absolution of souls, I, Bolesław Duke of Sandomierz, the son of Leszek the Duke&nbsp;of Kraków and Sandomierz, with the approval and assent of my mother Gremislava&nbsp;and of my barons, grant to the abbey of Jędrzejów and to the brothers serving God&nbsp;there for the soul of my father of pious memory, for my and my mother’s salvation, a&nbsp;village which is called Chańcza, and another which is called Boruchna, above [p. 9]&nbsp;the Czarna [river] adjoining Chańcza, and a third [village] above the Nidzica [river],&nbsp;which is called Beleuiz [Belewice [?]]. [I make this grant] to be possessed by&nbsp;perpetual right for perpetual alms with all the appurtenances of the same villages,&nbsp;namely with woods, with cultivated and uncultivated lands, meadows, waters, and&nbsp;with all their profits in hunting, in fishing, in beavers, in honey making, in birds and&nbsp;all the rest, just as [they] are delineated by boundary-marks and boundaries both by&nbsp;my order and through my baron Strzeżek with the approval and assent of [his] heirs&nbsp;and neighbours, indicating to those present and future that I have granted prescribed&nbsp;limits so freely that no one at all may touch them later, nor be permitted to sell or also&nbsp;to claim anything in that place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Moreover, since it please to set these my alms wholly free from every plaint, I confer&nbsp;liberty of every kind to the said villages, so plainly, that their inhabitants— whether&nbsp;they be freemen or serfs — should be totally exempt from every court of castles, nor&nbsp;be summoned before the palatine nor before any castellan, or before their judges, but&nbsp;only before the duke and this by his letter and seal. Nor should they pay poradlne, nor&nbsp;stróza, or cow,* which is called ‘the duke’s.’ Nor should they lead pouoz, nor pay the&nbsp;toll in my land. Nor should they go to castles, either for building as for fortifying or&nbsp;even plastering. We also render them totally free and immune from campaigns and&nbsp;from all exactions and payments. So that, however, this my donation should remain&nbsp;firm forever, I have strengthened this present charter by my seal and my mother’s.&nbsp;&nbsp;These things were done in Skała, in the presence of the noble lord Duke Henryk of&nbsp;Silesia, and such barons: Adam son of Leonard, Strzeżek, pedagogus Przybysław,&nbsp;chaplain Mikuł, magister Bogusław son of Stefan, in the year of the Lord 1235.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Cum sit pium et divinae authoritatis exemplum, iuste et religiose de resurrectione cogitatibus&nbsp;defunctorum elemozynarum subsidia ob remedium et plenam absolutionem impendere&nbsp;animarum, ego Boleslaus dux Sandomiriae, filius Lestconis ducis Cracouiae et Sandomiriae,&nbsp;laude et assensu dominae Grimislauae matris meae et baronum meorum contuli coenobio&nbsp;Andreoviensi et fratribus ibidem Deo servientibus pro anima patris mei piae memoriae, pro&nbsp;salute mea et matris meae villam, quae vocatur Chencza, et aliam, quae vocatur Boruchna,&nbsp;super Czarnam, Chenczae contiguam et tertiam super Nidziczam, quae vocatur Beleuiz, cum&nbsp;omnibus pertinentiis earundem villarum, videlicet silvis, terris cultis et incultis, pratis, aquis&nbsp;et omnibus utilitatibus earum in venationibus, piscationibus, castoribus, mellificiis, avibus et&nbsp;caeteris, ad&nbsp; perpetuam eleemozynam iure perpetuo possidendas, sicut et de mandato meo per&nbsp;baronem meum Strzesiconem laude et assensu haeredum et vicinarum signis et graniciis sunt&nbsp;terminatae, significans presentibus et futuris me tam libere contulisse, ut nulli omnino&nbsp;hominum in posterum illic contingat, nec liceat quidquid vindicare, aut etiam reclamare.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Porro, quoniam placuit hanc eleemozynam meam ab omni quaerela penitus expedire,&nbsp;omnimodam dictis villis imperpetuum confer libertatem, ita plane, quod incolae earum ab&nbsp;omni iure castrorum totaliter sunt exempti, sive sint liberi, sive servi, nec citentur coram&nbsp;pallatino, nec coram castellano aliquo, nec coram eorum iudicibus, sed tantum coram duce et&nbsp;hoc eius litteris et sigillo. Nec solvent poradlne, nec strosam, nec uaccam,* quae ducis dicitur.&nbsp;Nec ducant pouoz, nec solvat theloneum in terra mea. Nec eant ad castra, tam aedificanda,&nbsp;&nbsp;quam munienda, vel etiam linienda. De expeditionibus etiam et omnibus exactionibus et&nbsp;solutionibus eos totaliter reddimus liberos et immunes.
