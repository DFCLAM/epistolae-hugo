<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Elizabeth, by the grace of God senior/dowager queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and future who will look at the present page, greetings in the bestower of salvation.&nbsp; The prudence and careful benevolence of reginal piety admonishes and induces us that we meet with grateful spirit the loyalties and services expended opportunely for us by anyone, responding favorably with worthy retribution to their merits, since when we offer favor and consent to their labors and honest services, when we grant what they deserve, we invite others to wider works of loyalty more ardently and give back more readily to their readiness.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by the content of the presents that master Lawrence, son of count/</span><i style="background-color: transparent;">ispán</i><span style="background-color: transparent;"> Lawrence of the Aba family, our dearest relative, from the first years of his boyhood gave us agreeable and faithful service, not fearing to expose himself and his things for the honor of the royal crown in various kinds of dangers and many accidents of fate, of which the duke of Austria who did not wish to adhere to his fellowship to give loyalty to the royal crown, occupied three<em> castra</em> of master Lawrence, and took away innumerable goods that no one can justly assess.&nbsp; And since also when he helped in our legation with chosen horses, he endured loss of two hundred marks, and whom we brought to us through loyalty, by reason of proximity and in recompense for services, also in some satisfaction for his losses in things taken away, though it seems little in respect to his losses, the village of St. Martin in the county of Veröce with the certain knowledge and will of lord Ladislaus the king our dearest son and the consent of his barons and ours, with all its uses, namely vineyards, woods, meadows, surroundings and all appurtenances from the time of lady queen Maria our beloved mother of happy memory held through different lords and possessed and lost by their faults and often passed into our hands, we have given, granted, and conferred on that master Lawrence and through him on his heirs and their successor heirs under those boundaries and terms by which it had before been limited and possessed, to be possessed peacefully and irrevocably, breaking, invalidating, withdrawing, and pronouncing invalid documents and charters which came out through us or anyone on the deed of that village.&nbsp; In memory and desired stability of which thing we have granted the present letters to master Lawrence strengthened by the protection of the double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the prudent man master Lawrence provost of Pozsega our faithful chancellor of our court in the one thousand two hundred ninetieth year of the lord.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth dei gracia maior regina Hungarie omnibus Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam futuris presentem inspecturis salutem in salutis largitore.&nbsp;
