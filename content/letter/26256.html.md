<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>We Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary signify by the presents to all it reaches that although we took away from them certain of our reginal villages, called Beelc, Ráksi, and Dada, in the counties of Somogy and Tolna formerly conferred by us on the church of the Blessed Virgin and the religious and noble ladies, namely the sisters of the Buda Island serving the Lord in it perpetually, when we were in Somogy, yet since we seemed to have done this as injury to our soul; having had full and better deliberation of our heart, we have from reginal generosity as a remedy to our soul restored those villages with all their uses and appurtenances by the authority of the presents to said church and those ladies and sisters, and we have restored, and given them back, and we give them back to be possessed with perpetual right, as we were known to have conferred them earlier.&nbsp; Dated at Esztergom, fourth day of the Conversion of St. Paul the Apostle, in the 1290th year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Nos Elisabeth Dei gratia regina Hungarie significamus universis, quibus expedit, per presentes, quod licet quasdam villas nostras reginales Beelc, Rakusy et Dada vocatas in comitatibus Symigiensi et Tholnensi existentes, olim per nos ecclesie Beate Virginis et devotis ac nobilibus dominabus, sororibus videlicet de Insula Budensi, in eadem Domino jugiter famulantibus collatas nuper, cum in Symigio fuissemus constitute, abstulissemus ab eisdem, tamen quia hoc in dispendium anime nostre fecisse videbamur, habita plena et meliori deliberatione cordis nostri villas prenotatas ob remedium anime nostre ex munificentia reginali cum omnibus utilitatibus et pertinentiis earundem universis auctoritate presentium prefate ecclesie et dominabus ac sororibus eisdem restituendas duximus, necnon restituimus, reddidimus et reddimus perpetuo iure possidendas, prout eisdem primitus dinoscimur contulisse.&nbsp; Datum Strigonii, quarto die Conversionis sancti Pauli apostoli, anno domini Mo CCo nonagesimo.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The queen restores lands she had given and then taken back from the sisters of the Island of Rabbits.&nbsp; This was apparently a result of an investigation undertaken after the general assembly at Föveny in 1289.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Budapest történek okleveles emlékel.&nbsp; Monumenta diplomatica civitatis Budapest</i>, I (1148-1301), ed.
