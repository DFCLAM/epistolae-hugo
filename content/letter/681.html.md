<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Grant to Ebulo de Montibus and Joan his wife that out of all the lands late of Godfrey de Craucumbe, sometime husband of the said Joan, they may recover the dower of the said Joan according to the law and the custom of the realm; unless in the lifetime of the said Godfrey she quitclaimed her dower, and made acquittance to the king of the said lands, or did any other thing whereby she ought not of right to recover her dower, as may be seen by a scrutiny of the rolls of the Exchequer; and mandate to Queen Eleanor and R. earl of Cornwall, to cause the dower of the said Joan to be assigned to them out of the said lands so far as these pertain to the king, or out of other lands to the same value.
