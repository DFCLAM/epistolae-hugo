<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Maria, by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the presents, greetings in the savior of all.&nbsp; We wish to bring to the notice of all by the contents of the presents that since our dearest lord and consort Béla, illustrious king of Hungary had conferred on count Michael brother of Buzad the possession of Pucyna, son of Urban, called Lobor with a castle built in it, later Cheh, son of that Pucyna came to us and asserted that said possession Lobor and the castle were unduly taken from his father and asked that it be restored by our mediating grace.&nbsp; It is true that since the donation made without reasonable cause to said count Michael was not then revoked by the lord king, we noting the services of said Cheh which he performed in the kingdom and outside the kingdom faithfully fighting in our legations, the land of Dobouch in Pozsega coming immediately into our hands after donations made from that came to us from time to time from its possessors with the forest called Zoaberke extended In that quantity with respect to the latitude of that land of Dobouch, we conferred it in exchange of his said land Lobor and its castle on said Cheh and his heirs, if he should have them, to be possessed perpetually. Moreover, when a marriage was celebrated between that Cheh and Elizabeth, widow of Demetrius, lady-in-waiting of the consort of lord John, our dearest kinsman, at our urging, from our generosity we committed this grace that if Cheh should die without the solace of heirs before his said wife, then that wife would possess said land Dobouch with its uses as long as she lived, after her death it would revert in perpetual possession to&nbsp; the family of said Cheh as his heirs with full right/possession.&nbsp; The boundaries of that Dobouch and the forest, as in the letters to us from count Philip of Pozsega, to whose investigation we assigned it, are designated thus:&nbsp; The first boundary begins in the east from the root of a certain stony mountain, where Oroycha and Lypouch meet, thence it comes out in the south at a certain rise (<i>berch),</i> crossing through the river Lipouch to a mountain at whose apex is a land boundary, thence through that mountain it goes to a place where a stone is fixed in the earth for a boundary, thence it goes down again eastward into a valley to the river called Bregorinik, thence by that river it goes southward to a land called Bilote Oroycha, thence going through Bregorinik it goes to a mountain to a certain <i>berekune </i>tree signed with a cross, under which is a boundary at the mouth of a certain valley, then southward to an oak tree signed with a cross, under which is the boundary, thence it turns west and falls into a creek called Zuini, where the coboundary is called Dras and beside that place towards Oroycha is a certain open place called Nadoslaz, belonging to the Dobouch land, thence bending back it rises to a mountain to a hornbeam (<i>gertanfa)</i> tree, under which is a boundary and beside that place on the edge of the forest are three open places belonging to the Dobouch land:&nbsp; called Bogdasateluke, Boboycha and Vereklaz neighboring the lord of Dras, from said <i>gertanfa</i> tree it goes west descending by the mountain to the creek called Kuhnek, then going up again a little through that creek it goes out to a <i>gertanfa </i>tree where there is a boundary, then crossing by a little field it goes to the <i>nirfa</i> tree signed with a cross, where there is a boundary at a creek called Zkorun, then through that creek southward, where it falls into another creek called Dobouch, through which it goes southward to Zoaberke, at the entrance of which it is separated from the Dras boundary, then westward to a <i>gertanfa,</i> where there is one boundary Pose and another of the Dobouch land, then to a oak (<i>tulfa)&nbsp;</i>tree under which is a boundary, then again to a <i>tulfa</i>, under which is a boundary, thence to a third <i>tulfa</i> tree under which is a boundary, thence to a <i>bikfa</i>, where there is a boundary next to the creek called Skopchonik, through which it goes south from which it goes out to a forked <i>tulfa </i>tree, under which there is a boundary, thence to the Pokolasnik creek, thence it is turned back north and goes out to a village called Lower Urba of the <i>jobbágy*</i> Mortunus and through a field it goes beside the village up to a place where a certain small creek falls into Pokolosnik, thence it goes into a large space up to the Pokolosnik source, where it goes out to a bowl, from which it goes through three pear trees successively into a <i>brech,</i>&nbsp;under which are boundaries, thence it goes back to the Dobouch water, where Kolin is the coboundary; through that water it moves again into a large space and comes out from it above to a nut-tree to a <i>berch </i>over a cherry tree, thence again to the side of the mountain to a certain hill, thence to an old road, by which it goes above a certain vineyard, thence through the <i>brech</i> it goes to the root of the mountain Trichuch, thence it ascends to that mountain to a bowl, where it separates from Kolino, thence it goes to the land of Ivánka son of Drusk to a <i>berch</i>, thence it moves to the east to a place where there is a slope of that <i>berch </i>and there it&nbsp; descends to two streams which are joined, then it crosses through the <i>brech </i>and rises to another <i>berch</i>, through which it goes lengthwise towards the village of Zochan to a pear, where there is a boundary, thence to a <i>berekunefa</i>, thence through that <i>berch</i> going south from the section of the land Zkrabatnik it reverts to the prior boundary at the root of the stony mountain and there it ends.&nbsp; Said Cheh also has outside the said boundaries fishing areas in the Chernoch water, of which one is at the end of the field called Wnuhleu, another in Koponicha, and a barrier in the Knesnicha water, again a fourth fishing place in the Luki (Loki?) water, all of which belongs to the aforesaid land Dobouch.&nbsp; So that the present exchange and grace given by us may obtain the force of stability, we have given the present letters as witness, strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; In the thousand two hundred fiftyninth year.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Maria dei gracia regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus presentes inspecturis salutem in omnium saluatore.&nbsp;
