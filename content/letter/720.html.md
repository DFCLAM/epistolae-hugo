Know that we have appointed the masters beloved to us in Christ, Simon of Langton, archdeacon of Canterbury, and the abbot of St. Ragundia, to swear a truce in our person between the lord Louis your illustrious son and us.  And we make this known to you asking that you have them admitted for this by the aforesaid lord king, your son.
In witness of which thing, etc.
