<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Mandate to the tenants of the county of Chester and the land of North Wales to do their homage and fealty, saving the king’s allegiance, to Edward the king’s son and heir, to whom the king granted the same by charter to hold to him and his heirs, saving lands of the church (crociis) and the keeping of void churches.
By the queen on the royal command.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanor’s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
