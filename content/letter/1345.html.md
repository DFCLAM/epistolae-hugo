<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I, Ferrand, count of Flanders and Hainaut, and countess Joan my wife wish it to be known to all who will see the present letters that Gerard of Jaucea and [his] great-uncle William, and G. castellain of Beaumont, and Arnulph of Oudenaarde, and [his] father Baldwin of Comines, and Gilbert of Borghella, declare on oath that what lord Bouchard of Avesnes ought to have in Flanders or Hainaut, from heredity or the escheats of his wife, we should permit him to have without opposition; and we promised by pledge that we would observe this.  Dated at Ghent/Gand, on the Thursday after Easter, in the 1214th year of the Lord.
