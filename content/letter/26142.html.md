<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the Lord, amen.&nbsp; Let it be known to [persons] present and future that I, Grzymislawa, by the grace of God duchess of Kraków, [am confirming] the same village which my husband Leszek, late duke of Poland, granted to Nicholas, notary of Henry [I the Bearded], duke of Silesia.&nbsp; This same Nicholas gave this village, called Milejewice, to be possessed by hereditary right (hereditario iure possidendum) to his monastery (suo claustro) which is called Henryków, for the remedy of his soul and of the souls of his predecessors.&nbsp; In order that this gift not be subject to attempted violation by the snares of the wicked, I strengthened this present page with the protection of my seal, together with the seal[s] of lord Ivo bishop of Kraków and of Christian bishop of Prussia.&nbsp; These things were done in the year 1228 after the Incarnation of the Lord, on the first indiction of the month of March, in the assembly celebrated at Skaryszew, with the following witnesses present:&nbsp; lord Theodoric abbot of Jedrzejów, John provost of Miechów, Gregory dean of Saint Florian’s, Pakoslaw the palatine, Mark the palatine, Mszczuj castellan of Wislica.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>In nomine Domini amen.
