<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Commission to John de Lessington, G.de Preston, Geoffrey de Langeley, and Robert de Crepping to extend by jury all the lands late of William de Vescy in England, in demesnes, homages, rents, villeinages, woods, meadows, pastures, and other issues, and to send to the council the same extent.
By the queen.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
