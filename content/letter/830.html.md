<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The pope takes Agnes's monastery and its holdings under the protection of the apostolic see and affirms their freedoms and immunities.  The letter is almost the same as the later ep.159, dated 4/14/1237, which includes a reference to the hospital but not to the granges.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2>Bullarium Franciscanum, 1, p.171-72, ep.178; Codex Diplomaticus et Epistolarius Regni Bohemiae, ed. Gustavus Friedrich, 3.1, ep.118.
