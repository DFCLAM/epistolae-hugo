<h2> Translated letter:</h2>[summary]  To B., the countess, marchioness of Provence and countess of Forcalquier.  Whereas R. late count of Provence for 4,000 marks bound the castles of Uz√®s (Ozeda), Lauzet (de Lauseto) and Mende (de Mendis) and Forcalquier and Volonne (Valon') and certain other things as appears in letters patent thereof, the king requires her to receive and hold in the king's name the keeping of the said castles with the rents or profits arising therefrom and the other things bound to the king; and the king's will and command is that all those to whom he had committed the keeping of the said castles answer to her for them  and leave them to her in peace.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The castles which had been bound as security to the king when Beatrice negotiated a loan from him to her husband were in her keeping after her husband's death, but disputed by another son-in-law, Charles of Anjou.  She would eventually have to surrender them, but not until she had Henry's agreement.  The printed patent rolls give only a summary of the text in English.
