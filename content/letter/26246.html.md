<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>We lady Thomasina mother of lord Andrew by the grace of God illustrious king of Hungary, duchess of all Slavonia and governor of the land beyond the Danube as far as the sea, we signify by this to all to whom it reaches, entrusting to memory, that when master Conrad, son of Stephen of Owar on the fifteenth day of the residence of our army, according to the contents of our memorial letters, against lord B, bishop of Belgrade (Alba Bulgarica), for which master Peter his brother in his place and name appeared in that period/place with our letters, about the&nbsp; fact of the possession called Geresd, the documents and letters by which he held and possessed that land, that he had to show to us, in that coming term that same master Conrad personally appearing before us showed us his documents and letters; in which we saw contained that the count/<i>ispán</i> of Baranya in office at that time, together with the <i>jobbágyok</i> of that <em>castrum</em> had kept him out of said land Geresd and proceeded against him by judiciary order; that master Conrad asserted that the land Geresd was his heredity from his ancestors and it could be known by certain questioning of barons and other nobles that that land Geresd is and was said to be master Conrad’s, and since that count of Baranya and the <i>jobbágyok*&nbsp;</i>of said <em>castrum</em> could not proceed against him according to the path of justice, they left that land Geresd and its hereditary right to that master Conrad to be possessed peacefully.&nbsp; Whence we left that land Geresd to that master Peter in the name and place of that bishop B, to whom lord Andrew king of Hungary had conferred it, having seen the declaring letters of the lord king our dearest son imprinted with his ring-seal, indeed we had restored them to be perpetually and irrevocably peacefully possessed, held, and had, with absolutely no opposition.&nbsp; Dated in Pozsega on the octave of All Saints in the thousand two hundred ninetyfifth year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Nos domina Th. mater domini Andree Dei gracia Illustris Regis Hungarie, per eandem Ducissa tocius Sclauonie et Gubernatrix Citra-Danubialium Parcium usque mare, significamus vniuersis quibus expedit memorie commendantes; quod cum Magister Corradus filius Stephani de Owar in quindenis residencie exercitus nostri, secundum continenciam litterarum nostrarum memorialium, contra dominum B.
