<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth, by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ seeing the present writing greetings in the savior of all.&nbsp; Since the ornament of earthly magnificence and the glory granted by heavenly provision to princes, who live above others of the world&nbsp; over whom they rule, magnifies and extolls, it ought to provoke their heart and soul to submit devotion, to follow the will of divine grace and continually appease it with works of piety, so that particularly to the holy churches in which the indulgence of sinners is demanded for the intercession of the ministers of God, they should offer generous donations, or rather more surely immense, by the testimony of best known right, by those princes to whom God gave most, and who will be lord, governor and ruler of many.&nbsp; Thus it is that a virgin devoted to God, lady Elizabeth, nun from the Island of the Glorious Virgin (Island of Rabbits), our dearest kinswoman, sister of our illustrious lord king of Hungary, recently asked that a certain reginal town of ours, called Berény, located in the province of Somogy, be given by us and we would give and confer that town and possession called Berény to that lady Elizabeth, our dearest relative, effectually from the duty of relationship to that kinswoman we are held to be obliged to give to the extent it pleased her, whatever we had or possessed, most freely, from whom [so] much, namely in most precious things, like gold and riches of gems, jewels, and clothes and ready money whenever we were lacking and in need, we received from her to our will and desire; finally our said dearest relative, wished to give said town, called Berény, already given to her by us to the monastery of the most blessed archangel Michael namely Veszprém for the remedy of the soul of the illustrious king Stephen I of happy memory, her dearest father and our father-in-law; she already conferred it on that church, as she could, not unjustly, as a possession and town given absolutely to her person, to whatever private person she wished, also one in her service and office, or if she wished she could grant it freely and securely to a church of whatever place at her will, as a possession committed to her person by a most generous disposition, pressing willingly that we&nbsp; would deign to fix, ratify, confirm again by our charter her said donation made to the venerable church of Veszprém.&nbsp; We, wishing to acquiesce to the requests of our dearest sister-in-law while we live, [affirm that] the church possesses inviolably always and immoveably that said possession, said town called Berény, often mentioned above, the donation made by her to the venerable church of Veszprém, and through her to the provost of the church of Veszprém who was at the time in that provostial office, according to the vow of our dearest relative, so granting to the church that said possession was conferred to the provost or provosture was conferred by her, and by us, as she had conferred it, to be ratified in a similar way as soon as asked, we strengthen by the contents of our present charter the donation of our dearest relation will be validated in perpetuity, confirming as much as we can according to the desire of her heart that it is holy and just, and especially to the church of Veszprém, chiefly by reason that by the sworn relation of most honorable men and solemn persons we&nbsp; ascertained that formerly the noble and magnificent lady Maria, queen of Hungary of happy memory, consort of king Béla of honored memory, had granted that town called Berény to that church of Veszprém for the remedy of her soul, when the church of Veszprém had conditionaries* in that town called Berény and a great portion of that territory from ancient times, and from the first establishment of the above-named church, truly in the destruction of the church of Veszprém, sadly done in our time, the charter made on that donation with all the things and ornaments of the church known to us all were plundered and lost, about which a certain cut charter was presented to us, less efficacious from the seal broken in great part.&nbsp; Whence by most just witnesses, it appeared by other signs as we said above that our dearest relative deservedly and laudably made a donation of said possession to the holy church of Veszprém carefully, which we affirmed as right and approved most firmly by the tenor of our present charter.&nbsp; Moreover we add that when our lord, the illustrious king, bestowed on us in that town Berény eight dwellings of <i>udvarnoks</i>** in exchange particularly of our possessions which he received from us, namely the great town Ladan, and another town called Berény in the county of Alba over the river Saar, near Alba; we, at the instance of our dearest sister-in-law lady Elizabeth, bestowed said town Berény in the manner and for the reason stated, similarly we gave those eight dwellings of <i>udvarnoks </i>received in exchange from the lord king with the said totality of the town of Berény, and equally for this reason to the church of Veszprém, to which said lady Elizabeth our relative gave possession and the town of Berény, and also with it the eight dwellings of <i>udvarnoks</i> given to us by the lord king in exchange, as the royal charter of this shows, and given by us to lady Elizabeth our relative with the whole town, as the donation of the town of Berény, so the possessions of those eight dwellings of the oft-mentioned <i>udvarnoks,</i> their persons, descendants and heirs, and everything they hold and possess and with the conditionaries of the church of St. Michael the Archangel, similarly, we ratify as said donation to the town of Berény and by the authority of the presents we confirm it will endure in perpetuity.&nbsp; For the stability and most holy witness of which thing we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Thomas, by the grace of God bishop of Vaciens, our faithful chancellor of our court, in the thousand twohundred eighty third year of the lord; fourth kalends of October.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elisabeth Dei gracia Regina Hungarie universis Christi fidelibus presens scriptum intuentibus salutem in omnium Saluatore.&nbsp;
