<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Isabella by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ who will look at the present writing eternal greetings/salvation in the Lord.&nbsp; Sudden calamity that occurs to things of faithful servants ought not to obscure their merits and even if&nbsp; accidents that happened might cause a change to bias against them, it should be restored with accustomed piety from reginal generosity.&nbsp; Therefore we wish it to be made known to the notice of those in the future by the content of these, that when lady Elizabeth, queen, our dearest mother-in-law conferred on count Michael and his wife, wetnurse of our lord Ladislaus illustrious king of Hungary in recompense for their services and devoted attendance on him with tireless zeal from the cradle of his infancy, a certain reginal town called Olnymuty in the county/<i>ispánate</i> of Vizsoly by perpetual right and confirmed it with her letters, yet since in the criminal destruction of wars which occurred between barons of the kingdom of Hungary by divine retribution, by unforeseen chance through the multitude of attacks, that Michael and his wife lost those donation letters with their other goods at Buda, we recognizing the claim of their loyalty at the urgency of their petition, wishing to restore from the fullness of favor, applying new remedies to the old donation from our grant, we gave, donated, and conferred said town, which they had had from the donation of our said mother-in-law, with woods and hayfield and its other uses and appurtenances on them and through them on their heirs and successors of their heirs anew from our special grace, to be possessed by perpetual right and irrevocably.&nbsp; Therefore so that the content of this donation and grant of ours might have the strength of pertual stability, and cannot or ought not be withdrawn in the course of time by anyone or attacked in any way, we have granted the present letters strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Philip, bishop of Vác, our faithful chancellor of our court in the 1275th year of the Lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p><span>Isabella Dei gratia regina Hungarie universis Christi fidelibus presens scriptum inspecturis salutem in Domino sempiternam. Repentina rerum calamitas fidelium servitiorum non debet merita obfuscari et siquid casibus irrumpentibus fuerit in eorum preiudicium immutatum a reginali munificentia debeat pietate solita restaurari. Proinde universorum tam presentium, quam futurorum notitie harum serie fieri volumus manifestum, quod cum domina Elyzabeth regina socrus nostra karissima comiti Mychaeli et uxori sue nutrici domini nostri Ladislai illustris regis Vngarie in recompensationem serviciorum et famulantium devotorum, que iidem ab ipsius infantie cunabulis indefesso studio impenderunt, quandam villam reginalem Olnymuty vocatam in comitatu de Wysl existentem iure perpetuo contulisset suisque litteris confirmasset, quia tamen inter incestinam bellorum cladem, quam inter barones regni Vnhariea divina ingessit ultio casu inopinato per irruentium multitudine cum aliis bonis suis apud Budam iidem Mychael et uxor eius easdem donationes litteras amiserunt, nos ad instantiam petitionis eorundem fidelitatis sue titulos annoscentes ex plenitudine gracie restaurari de predicta cupientes donationi veteri nova ex nostre collationis remedia adhibendo, prefatam villam, quam ex donatione predicte socrus nostre fuerant consecuti cum silva et feneto ac aliis utilitatibus suis et pertinentiis eisdem et per eos suis heredibus heredumque suorum successores ex novo ex nostra speciali gratia dedimus, donavimus et contulimus iure perpetuo et irrevocabiliter possidendam. Ut igitur huius nostre donationis seu collationis series robur obtineat perpetue firmitatis, nec processu temporum per quempiam possit vel debeat aliquatenus irruitum retractari, presentes concessimus litteras duplicis sigilli nostri munimine roboratas.
