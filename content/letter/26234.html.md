<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Ladislaus by the grace of God king of Hungary to his dearest mother queen Elizabeth, health/salvation which he desires for himself with the deepest affection of the heart.&nbsp; As we believe our kingdom and crown and the proceedings of our regime are without doubt and most willingly governed by the supporting merits of our holy ancestors and especially suffused&nbsp; by the patronage of the most holy king Stephen, our dearest mother compelled our heart not unworthily to beat with vehement admiration that in certain things to be done by us, especially spiritual, with the counsel of your discernment and direction it would be expedient to emend our youthful actions; whence it proceeds that in the person of your love, with physical power urging downwards, the invasion of ecclesiastical possessions and undue desolation and occupation enflamed and strengthened, attempted against god and justice.&nbsp; Since we have very often asked through our frequent messengers and letters in the desired union of sincere love, that you give up and restore the possession of the church of the most holy king Stephen of Zagreb called Vaska, occupied against god and justice, the fear of god as well as our pursuing prayers have had no effect, but rather, as we hear and are told by our messengers, that possession has been severely and miserably brought to extreme diminution.&nbsp; Therefore we ask with affection as much as we can, that you give up and return said possession to the said church, and make restitution for the injuries and harm done to it fully, otherwise if the said venerable father compelled by obvious necessity should proceed against your person and people by ecclesiastical condemnation, you could not blame us, who have so often asked you, nor him.&nbsp; For we by royal duty of office cannot fail the lord bishop, nor deny after so many repeated warnings his authority to pursue his right.&nbsp; Dated in Potok, on the feast of St. Dominic the confessor, in the 1284th year of the lord.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Ladislaus dei gracia rex Hungarie carissime matri sue domine Elisabeth regine salutem, quam sibi optat intimo cordis affectu.&nbsp; Quum nos regnum nostrum et coronam ac regiminis nostri processum, suffragantibus meritis sanctorum progenitorum nostrorum, et presertim sanctissimi regis Stephani patrocinio suffulti, indubitanter credamus propensius gubernari, admiracione vehementi mater carissima cor nostrum concuti non immerito compellitur, quod cum in quibusdam nostris agendis, ac presertim in spiritualibus, vestre discrecionis consilio et regimine etiam nostri iuveniles actus esset expediens emendare; unde hoc proveniat, ut in persona vestre dileccionis, iam urgente deorsum virtute corporea, accendatur et invalescat possessionum ecclesiasticarum invasio et desolacio et occupacio indebita, contra deum et iusticiam attentata.&nbsp; Quum etenim per nostros frequentes nuncios et litteras nostri sinceri amoris desideratam amoris unionem sepius requisissemus, ut possessionem ecclesie sanctissimi regis Stephani de Zagrabia, Vaska vocatam, occupatam contra deum et iusticiam, relinqueretis et restitueretis, nullum effectum tam timor domini, quam nostra sunt precamina consequuta, sed pocius, ut refertur, et nobis constat per nuncios nostros, ipsa possessio ad exinanicionem extremam severius et miserabilius est deducta.&nbsp; Quapropter adhuc petimus affeccione qua possumus, quatenus relinquatis et remittatis possessionem prefatam ecclesie memorate, et de iniuriis et damnis illatis satisfieri faciatis ad plenum, alioquin, si prefatus venerabilis pater tam euidenti necessitate compulsus, contra personam vestram et vestros ecclesiasticam processerit per censuram, nec nobis, quando sepius vos requisiverimus, nec eidem poteritis imputare.&nbsp; Nos etenim ex regali debito officii eidem domino episcopo deesse non possumus, nec post tot admoniciones iteratas licenciam in prosequucione iuris sui aliquatenus denegare.&nbsp; Datum in Potok, in festo sancti Dominici confessoris, anno domini MCCLXXXIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2><p>The king, reminding his mother how she has inspired him to good acts, urges her with thinly veiled threats, to restore the tithes she has usurped from the bishop of Zagreb. The dating is confusing, because her letter agreeing to restore them is dated in the previous year, and in two other charters dated a few months before this one (6.482-83, #400 and 483-84, #401, dated June 7, 1284), Ladislaus makes public declarations on the dispute between his mother and the bishop of Zagreb, noting the truth of the bishop’s claims and his mother’s restitution of the tithes.&nbsp; &nbsp;The king invokes an 11th century &nbsp;ancestor, St. Stephen.</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Printed source:</h2><p><i>Codex diplomaticus regni Croatiae, Dalmatiae et Slavoniae</i>, ed.
