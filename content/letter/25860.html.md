<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>To the illustrious lady Blanche, countess palatine of Troyes, dearest in Christ, Th., prioress, and the convent of nuns of Annecy, greetings in the Lord and the grace of prayers.&nbsp; You should know that in the problem that arose between us on one side and the abbot and chapter of Notre-Dame of Vertus on the other over ten pounds, which were assigned to us by Eustache, late lord of Conflans in the land of lady Adelaide in perpetual alms, and over the 60 solidi in the market stalls of Vertus bequeathed to us by that same Eustache, we submitted in arbitration to you, to whatever regulations according to the reasoning of deeds and arguments of each side will be held firm, so that if perhaps disagreement, let it not be, should yet arise over the arbitrated solution, we would be brought back to agreement through your bailiff, Morel.&nbsp; Enacted in the 1218th year of the Lord, in the month of November.<i></i></p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Illustri domine Blanche Trecensis comitisse palatine, in Christo karissime, Th. priorissa et conventus monialium de Andeceiis, salutem in Domino et orationum munus.
