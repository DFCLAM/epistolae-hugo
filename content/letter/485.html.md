<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Louis by the grace of God king of the French, greetings to all who see the present letters.
We make known that since there is a dispute between our dearest mother-in-law the countess of Provence on one side and our dearest and loyal brother, Charles, count of Anjou and Provence on the other, over the fruits and revenues of the county of Provence and Forcalquier and the marchionate of Provence and the rights which are or could pertain to that countess in any way in the aforesaid lands and in whatever land belonged to Raymond Berengar of good memory, former count of Provence, husband of that countess, as well as over certain agreements between them and over arrears, which the countess said were owed to her by those agreements, and over the damages which that countess said were inflicted on her and her people and supporters by our brother and his men, and over certain donations and bequests which she said were made to her either by dower and legacy or by other causes, and especially over the 8000 silver marks and other sums of money which she sought from our brother, about which she said a part was to be paid in her life and a part after her death, finally said parties, for the sake of peace, promised on the previous matters and submitted themselves to our ruling over  the previous and the following in all things (the whole) and in everything (separate items) high and low, consenting and willing that we say and enact our will on the aforesaid and whatever else pertains thereto or may pertain, promising by corporal oath that they will observe and hold our ruling, our word or judgment in whatever article, and not oppose it in any part directly or indirectly, nor instigate any opposition.
We, having carefully considered these matters, with the will and assent of both parties, rule and state our judgment, that said countess quitclaim and hand over henceforth and leave in perpetuity to our said brother, to his wife and their heirs, all the aforesaid lands and every right that she has in those lands or that pertains or can pertain to her in them in any way as to possession or property, excepting the land which said countess is said to hold by concession of churches, that is Valenciole, Villedieu and St. Genisius, with the appurtenances of said churches or places depending on those churches, and excepting other movable goods or claims and debts which are owed to her in the aforesaid counties, about which said count is held to compel the debtors without making war.  And she will hand over to our brother or his seneschal in Provence in the name of the count, or others whom that count deputed for it, and will assign possession of said lands, castles as well as other appurtenances to the aforesaid lands, along with the pledges and homages of the men of those lands by the next [feast of the] Purification of the blessed virgin.
We enjoin said countess and say by our judgment that she quitclaim/release completely and absolve in perpetuity our brother, his wife and their heirs, from the agreements, donations, bequests, damages, arrears, and whatever else named above.  We also enjoin said countess that she restore to that count our brother or his seneschal in Provence all letters and instruments whatsoever that she has, has had, and might have whether from the gaugery [chancellery?] of the king of England or from all and any others mentioned separately above by the next [feast of the] Purification of the Blessed Virgin.  And if any documents on the aforesaid matters should be found afterwards, we pronounce that henceforth they are to be held nullified.  We also enjoin said countess to restore the Lombards whom she seized with their money and goods to said count our brother in the term indicated.  We also enjoin that countess to renounce before the bishop of Belley or his delegate the summons brought for her against our brother by apostolic authority.  We also enjoin that countess to cease/refrain from offense and injury to the seneschal of Provence and other supporters and allies of our brother.
At the same time, we enjoin our said brother and say by our judgment that for handing over the aforesaid, he pay that contess or her messenger every year as long as said countess lives, 6000 Tours pounds (TL) according to the following terms, namely on the octaves of the coming Purification of the Blessed Virgin 2000 TL, on the following octaves of the Ascension of the Lord, 2000 TL, and on the following octaves of the feast of all saints 2000 TL, and so on from year to year as long as said countess lives.  We, however, constitute ourselves and our heir who succeeds us in the kingdom principal debtors for the payment of said money by the warrant of our said brother to that countess.  We promise in good faith to pay her or her specified messenger in Paris at the Temple annually as long as that countess lives, said money at the appointed terms, and our said brother, by agreement between us, will be held to fully satisfy our seneschal at Beaucaire in our name with the aforesaid money at Beaucaire.  That count our brother wished however and conceded that if it should happen that he or his heirs failed to pay said money at Beaucaire, as specified above, we could take and seize without injury as much of the goods that he holds from us as would repay what we or our said heir paid to satisfy [that debt].  And to this he obligated himself and his heirs and is held to produce letters patent from himself and his wife on said obligation.
We also enjoin said count our brother to give and pay that countess or her agent beyond the mentioned sum of 6000 TL, 5000 TL at one time, on the coming octave of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin in Paris at the Temple, for the damages, arrears, agreements, donations, bequests and whatever else she might seek from our said brother or his wife or their heirs, and what pertained or might pertain to that countess in her life or after her death for whatever cause against our brother, his wife and their heirs.   For the payment of said 5000 TL to be made on the octave of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin, as noted above, we as the agent of our brother constitute ourselves the principal debtor to the oftmentioned countess.
We also enjoin our oftmentioned brother by our judgment to cease/refrain from all offense and injury against the knights Fulk of Puy Richard and William Artoudi and give back all their movable goods or claims and immovables which said count or his men took from them and the father of said William Artoudi in the course of this dispute.  We also enjoin our brother to commit no violence or injury on William of Ravenna, citizen of Sisteron, as long as he remains loyal, provided that said William of Ravenna render the account of the stewardsip that he held for R. Berengar of good memory, count of Provence, and either render anything that he still has or our brother should pay him if said count owes something to him.  And let the accounting and reckoning be made before Guido Falcodi and determined by his judgment.
We also enjoin our said brother to receive the [oath of] fidelity from the knights, brothers, William and Walter of Forcalquier, and continue them in that freedom in which said countess held them.  Nor should he or his court do any violence or injury to them, except for the right of that count to what the count is said to have bought from Giraud Guerso, knight, their brother, the part that he owed him from the paternal inheritance.  And if said two brothers and their brother William of Pertuis wished to pay the money which said count gave for the aforesaid sale, they would be entirely quit of the claim of said count to it and said count would cede to them the right which pertains to him from said sale.  If however said Giraud wishes to bring a claim against said brothers over the aforesaid, it may not be heard in the count's court, unless he paid those brothers the price he received.  And if said brothers can not or will not render said money at the same time, let whichever be heard on his third [share].
We also enjoin our said brother to cease/refrain from all offense and injury against the knight Boniface of Castellana and to be a good and loyal lord to him.  We also enjoin our brother to cease/refrain from offense and injury to all the men and other supporters and friends of said countess, and to be a good and loyal lord to them, and that neither he nor his court do any violence to them against justice and that he disseise and restore the things taken or seized in the course of the dispute, immovables, movables, and claims which came into the hands of said count or his men.
We also will and enjoin our brother to ratify the judgments handed down by that countess or her court and other acts and contracts made in the time of her rule, nor revoke nor permit to be revoked by his court those things in so far as appropriate, except for the inheritance of that count and his heirs.  We also enjoin our brother to return to Amelius of Courbain, knight, the land taken from his mother in the course of this dispute.
Moreover it is enacted and consented by the oaths sworn between the count and countess that she will hand over, by the Purification to said count or his seneschal of Provence, if she have licence from the king of England to obtain which she will work in good faith within her power, the castles mentioned below pledged to that king of England as it is said for 4000 marks sterling:  namely, Forcalquier, Volonce, Médis, and Oseda.  And with this deliverance and settlement made to the king of England, by which said count, having made payment, is released from debt, that count is held to pay said countess or her representative, in the house of the Temple at Paris on the coming feast of St. Remigius, said 4000 marks sterling except for
 deduction from said 4000 marks of expenses of upkeep of those castles and revenues and rents according to the stipulations of the aforesaid loan, over which deduction said countess will stand in good faith, having made a careful investigation of it, according to what she will certify to us or our said brother by her patent letters within the term of said Purification; on the payment to be made at said place and time, if said count should be in default to said countess, we would constitute ourselves the principal debtor.  
It is to be known also that by the payments made by us to that countess, that count our brother will be freed of the obligation of that money and of that term or terms by which the payments are made, as it pertains to said countess and not to us. It was also agreed between us and our said brother that if that brother should default in any way in said payments, all damages and losses which we, on this occasion, should incur, our said brother will recompense us for in  full, and to this he obligated himself and his heirs, all their goods or moveables and immoveables or what might be moved, wherever they should be; and on this our said brother should hand over to us his patent letters and those of his wife with their oath.  
Said countess, approving and agreeing to this decree and decision of ours, made the said quittances, remissions, and absolutions in our presence and accepted each and every one of the said arrangements in whatever article.  Moreover our said brother, approving and agreeing to each and every said arrangement in whatever article, obligated himself and his heirs to observing the aforesaid and will do and make sure that his wife will similarly approve the arrangements, having taken a corporal oath on it.
Also on the matter of the Dauphin it was agreed that on the archbishop of Vienne, named on the part of said count from the coming Easter for four years, who could bring together in peace and justice said count our brother and said Dauphin within the term; and pending said agreement, no injury would be caused by said count or his men. If either of said arbiters should die, he whose arbiter had died, could substitute another at his will in place of the dead [man]. 
The aforesaid countess and count promised to observe each and every arrangement, not to oppose but to fulfill them, with a corporal oath on this sworn by them; except that if said countess would not hand over said four castles of Forcalquier, Volonce, Médis, and Oseda to said count or his seneschal of Provence by the next Purification of the blessed virgin, it was agreed and consented between that countess and count that each and every above agreement would be broken and vain and [not] of better moment, nor will one remained obligated to the other because of this order or agreement, nor will our said brother be obligated to us nor will we be to that countess in any way, and the oaths and actions taken on each side by the agreement they had had between them would remain in effect between them as they had been before this agreement, and a firm truce would stand and last in every relevant case between said count and countess and their men and their supporters until the octave of the coming Easter for the whole day.
In witness and protection of this thing and we have had the present letters protected by the impression of our seal.  
We, said count and countess, in witness and protection of the arrangements, have had our seals appended to the present letters  along with the seal of his excellency lord Louis, king of the Franks.  
Enacted at Paris, in the one thousand two hundred fifty sixth year of the lord, in the month of November, on the Monday after All Saints.

Nos autem, constituentes nos et heredem nostrum qui nobis succedet in regno principales debitores super solutione predicte pecunie facienda de mandato dicti fratris nostri eidem comitisse, promittimus bona fide nos sibi vel suo certo nuncio solvere Parisius apud Templum annuatim quoad vixerit eadem comitissa, predictam pecuniam terminis prenotatis, et dictus frater noster, ex conventione inter nos et ipsum habita, tenetur eisdem terminis senescallo nostro Belliquadri nomine nostro apud Belliquadrum pleniarie satisfacere de pecunia supradicta.

<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>The king renders his detailed arbitration judgment in the continuing conflict between his brother Charles of Anjou and their mother-in-law, Beatrice, countess of Provence.  He awards the disputed lands to Charles, but orders his brother to pay a sizeable annual sum for them, for which sum he stands surety.  The French translation of this document by Viard names the count's choice for archbishop of Vienne, Barral de Baux.
