<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>Elizabeth by the grace of God queen of Hungary to all the faithful of Christ present and future, eternal greetings in the Lord.&nbsp; It is just and proper to equity that the rights/properties of subjects which were occupied by a mass of violence or the malice of [false] accusations, when the truth is known should grant that everything be restored to the former truth of right/property.&nbsp; Therefore we wish to bring to the notice of all by these contents that Master Alexander, son of Theodore of Bábony of the county of Somogy coming into our presence begged us humbly that we would have restored to him, by owed benevolence and kindness, half of his hereditary land of Bábony, to three ploughings, which lady queen Maria, former consort of the illustrious king Béla of bright memory, took violently from his father Theodore, and had assigned to the reginal staff/servants, namely her wine-suppliers for their use.&nbsp; So we, not wishing to oppress the rights of others or justice by the duty of our office, since we are held to preserve each one in his justice from the endeavors of the received regime lest injury arise from the [wrongful] occupation of anyone’s property; whence we ought by legitimate ways restrain the boldness of usurpation, having consulted our faithful barons, at the request also of our lord the illustrious king, our dearest consort, about the restoration and reformation of the half of that land of Bábony to our loyal chapter of Alba and also the nobles of county Somogy and Tolna, who shared the county and the province of that land, in owed loyalty and faith to the crown we gave orders that they investigate everything in this business and write back the truth they have learned.&nbsp; <br>Which chapter of Alba wrote back their letters in these words:&nbsp; to their most excellent lady Elizabeth, by the grace of God illustrious queen of Hungary; [letter not cited]<br>This is what the nobles from the county of Somogy and Tolna wrote back fully of their owed faith and loyalty to the royal crown.&nbsp; And though we gave our granting charter at the first request of that Master Alexander to restore his right/property the first time; so that when the initiated truth might more timely shine in light, knowing that from the repeated investigation of the truth of that business, we were more fully informed more certainly, that the said half of the land of Bábony to the extent of three ploughings was the right/property of that Master Alexander and his father, who always possessed the other half in peace; desiring that what had been disturbed by malevolent instigation, should be restored to the pristine right:&nbsp; since that Master Alexander gave devoted service to our lord king and his father and grandfather, illustrious kings, as well as to us in the commands or affairs of our serenity; the half of said land of Bábony to three ploughings, with all its plenitude and conditions and appurtenances, we have restored to that Master Alexander and through him to his heirs and their successors to be possessed in perpetuity; imposing perpetual silence on the wine-suppliers over this.&nbsp; So that no dispute or matter for argument may arise in the future, we have granted the present letters in perpetual stability of that thing strengthened by the protection of our double seal.&nbsp; Dated by the hand of the venerable father Thomas, bishop of Vachyensis chancellor of our court in the thousand two hundred eightieth (1280th) year of the lord.</p><p></p><p></p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2><p>Elyzabeth Dei gracia Regina Hungarie vniuersis Christi fidelibus tam presentibus quam futuris salutem in Domino sempiternam.&nbsp;
