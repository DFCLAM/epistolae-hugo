<h2> Translated letter:</h2>In the name of the holy and indivisible trinity.  In the year of the incarnation of our lord Jesus Christ 1109.  While countess Matilda was residing at San Cesario, Wibert of Gonzaga complained that she was unjustly lodging her men, namely John Viventium and his fellow brothers from Canusa, dwelling in Correggio.  She promised to do justice to them, and sending Odald, her judge, so that he might question ministers and good men of that place called together and discover the truth for her.  He, fulfilling commands, came to that place and summoned to him Girard, count of that land, and Roland and Manfred Bonsenior, jurors of the same place, and Cosbert and Albizo of Valle Putrida and Alegro John Robald and Rodulf of Canusa and he requested of them the truth and justice of this matter.  All testified that they had been lodged against justice and she should not rightly lodge them.  Once the truth was known, the countess promised that she would observe this and commanded to all her ministers and gave the order to lodge them no longer.
