<h2> Translated letter:</h2>I Joan, countess of Flanders and Hainaut, make known to all both future and present to whom these letters will have come, that my faithful John Cardon and lady Beatrice, his wife, gathered in my presence, have quitclaimed to the abbot and convent of Saint Peter of Oudenburg the dwelling and land and meadow and pasture and wood that lie in Emelghem, in Cacthem and in Iseghem with all their appurtenances, which Giles Canis of good memory conferred as perpetual alms to the abbot and convent, and they have surrendered whatever right they had to the aforesaid dwelling and its appurtenances.  And for the confirming the good of peace between the abbot himself and his convent on one side and on the other the aforesaid John and lady Beatrice his wife, the aforesaid abbot, with the agreement of his convent, has conceded that he will give each year within eight days of the birthday of Lady Beatrice, daughter of the aforesaid John and lady Beatrice, for assistance of her marriage, 10 pounds in the currency of Flanders and, when the abbot of Oudenburg is deceased, John himself and lady Beatrice, his wife, will have from the abbot, by new arrangement, 50 shillings.
	And because all these things were done and drawn up in my presence, at the requests of the aforesaid John and lady Beatrice, his wife, I have granted that as lady of the land I will cause to be observed firmly this agreement as is written above and I have brought to the same abbot and convent the present document concerning this, validated by the affixing of my seal and strengthened by the recording below of witnesses who were present.  My faithful witnesses:  Philip, marquis of Namur, Michael of Haren, Hellin steward of Flanders, Michael constable of Flanders, John of Mecheln, Walter of Courtrai, protonotary of Flanders, my clerk Philip of Dergneau, Roger my clerk.
	Done at Courtrai, Monday before the Epiphany of the Lord, in the year of the Lord’s Incarnation 1220, in the month of January.(1)
