<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>In the name of the holy and indivisible Trinity. Adelaide, formerly wife of lord John of Avesnes, defender of Holland and Zeeland, to all faithful of Christ who will view the present letters, in perpetuity. Since human weakness is unstable and inclined to harmful things and does not stand up to confusion, it is useful that those things that are known to be pious deeds carried out by modern [people] are also prudently preserved in written testimony. Therefore may both present and future (people) know that, since the abbess and convent of the church of the blessed Virgin Mary in Rinjsburg had possessed peacefully and quietly, as their allod, certain property, namely certain land in the parish of Noordwijk lying within Zidewende, approximately 9.5 lant, and in the same place certain lands which are called Werft, conferred by a former countess of Holland by the name of Petronilla, of happy memory, as alms for the church mentioned, with all right belonging to the said countess, also certain lands called <em>vronegers</em> lying between the villas of Noordwijk and Voorhout as well as the lands lying in the hamlets or villas of Lisse and Vlodorp, formerly of the lay brothers Ouger and Arnold, called Geir, living in Rijnsburg, and also lands located formerly at Lisekine, part in Lisse, part in Hiltsebroic, until for the usefulness of the aforenoted monasteryhaving considered the advice of prudent people the aforesaid abbess and convent decided to make an exchange now of said property or aforewritten lands with Theodore, knight, lord of Teylingen, for any tithes, both larger and smaller, both in wet and in dry (land), located in the parishes of Kercwerve and Rijnsburg, which the same knight held from us in fealty, with our consent and will, transferring through our hand the aforesaid property or lands to the knight mentioned, Theodore, which property and lands the aforesaid knight in place of the aforesaid tithes which he first held from us, received from our hand in fealty, paying due homage to us for these same things, except the land lying in the marsh which is called Hiltsebroic, extending from the wood of Hillinghem up to Mere and containing 11yards in width, which the abbess and convent of the aforenoted monastery reserved for their own use, but with said knight, Theodore, surrendering the above-said tithes to us, we, with pious consideration and for the sake of eternal salvation have conferred freely and absolutely these same things, with all right and dominion that could belong to us or our nephew Floris or our successors in these same things, to the church of holy Mary in Rijnsburg for the use and support of the abbess and convent of the aforenoted church, such that certainly the aforesaid abbess and convent will enjoy the aforewritten tithes with right of patronage of the church of Kercwerve that belonged to the same knight for that same thing, but the said knight, Theodore, will enjoy the aforewritten property or lands thus transferred to him and exchanged for the said tithes, with full right perpetually. For this deed and exchange were present: renowned ladies Elisabeth, formerly queen of the Romans, our mother, Mathilde, countess of Holland, our aunt, Richardis, lady-in-waiting of Holland, as well as the noblemen H. lord of Vorne, Simon of Haarlem, W. lord of Brederode, lord John Persin, and Hugh of Noordwijk, knights, whose seals are affixed to the present [letters]. Also in testimony and proof of this deed made and fuller and perpetual strength of certainty we have caused the present document to be confirmed by the seal affixed of Theodore lord of Teylingen and consigned with the protection of our seal. Dated in the year of the Lord 1258, on the day of blessed Gertrude, at Rijnsburg. (1)</p><h2 class="mt-4"> Original letter:</h2>In nomine sancte et individue Trinitatis.
