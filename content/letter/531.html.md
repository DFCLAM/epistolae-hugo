<h2> Translated letter:</h2>To the most serene prince and our dearest nephew, lord Edward, by grace of God most illustrious king of England, Marguerite, by that same grace queen of France, greetings and affection of sincere love.
Since Peter of Berengar and William of Richard de Leure, nephew of that Peter, were good, faithful, and necessary at the time of the English dissension to our friends and especially to your mother, our dearest sister, for whom in our view they procured loans of many sums of money and did other courtesies, and our people, as we understand, ... collectors of your customs on the island of Kencipui (Cheneche?), clearly extorted, and without cause, a certain quantity of money from said WIlliam, ... and the goods, things, and money of said William.  We ask your sincerity that, considering said courtesies, you not permit that William to be harmed without cause by any one [representing] your power in any way, and that you have the things said to have been extorted from him, restored to him completely, so that he feels that our prayers to you have benefited him.
Dated Pontisare (?), Friday after Ash [Wednesday].
