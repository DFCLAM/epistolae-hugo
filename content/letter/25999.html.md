<h2> Translated letter:</h2><p>How useful it might be, and how effective for all the faithful to relieve the necessities of the servants of God, and to prepare those patrons and friends against the evil of Mammon, by those who will be received in the eternal tabernacle, noone who conforms a narrow understanding to reason should ignore.&nbsp; For the Lord who commands nothing except what is good for us, orders this, and the life of the good which is a living lesson manifests this with a clear light by its examples.&nbsp; Which if it is encouraged for all by beatific and salutary action, how much more effective is this for the rich and powerful of this world, who because of the excessive abundance of delights/luxuries give less care to the things of God, and who on the other hand, occupied with the tumults of cases and affairs, sin very often and very seriously in several [ways].&nbsp; These, I say, should most redeem their sins by alms, so that they may share not undeservedly in spiritual things whose carnal things are disseminated among the servants of God.&nbsp;</p><p>I Countess Adela, admonished on this often by Maurice, abbot of the monastery of Blois, where the body of St. Lomer is visited with appropriate honor, found it worthy to enlarge and increase with things of my holdings the benefaction for the brothers of said place and their monastery.&nbsp; I therefore give and grant to St. Lomer and the brothers of the monastery of Blois for the soul of my dearest spouse, count Stephen, and for the soul of my father and my mother, and also for my salvation, and the succession of my children, a certain part of my forest which is called Long Forest from the place which is called great Oucques to the land of William son of Fredo in length.&nbsp; In width, from a certain street which is called the street of Fest as it runs from great Oucques and falls into the valley of St. Victor as far as the forest goes up to the plain on the side that looks to Montfollet, and Beauce (?Belsia) Blois, and so I give freely what I have held to now by gift of my dearest spouse; thus I grant to said saint and the monks who profess there, and the guests whom they can keep there that they are free from every custom altogether and will suffer no&nbsp; persecution from any of my successors or my officials.&nbsp; Also with similar benefit I grant to St. Lomer and the brothers of said place the banlieu, and if I had any other custom in the borough/bourg of St. Nicholas up to now, as much as the land holds which Praxede and her son Astho Borel gave to that saint, and let it be altogether free like the tax on St. Lomer.&nbsp; The road which runs between the bourg&nbsp; and the vineyards is next to the boundaries of said land.&nbsp; I similarly give and grant to the brothers of said place&nbsp;entirely free from all payment of custom to do whatever they may wish with it or in it.&nbsp; From the revenue of my stores, I bestow no less three measures of salt every year from now on, and entreating I command that all who succeed me, heirs or officials, are not to inflict harm on them by any cause or delay or whatever trick over this benefice of mine.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: transparent;">Therefore granting all these to St. Lomer according to the wording of this description, I have signed the present charter with my subscription, and had it strengthened by my children granting the same and subscribing.&nbsp; The monks promised me as reciprocal benefit they would sing one mass each week in the convent for my salvation and would feed one pauper daily in alms.&nbsp; When God however wishes to remove me from my body they will offer daily for one year the mystery for my peaceful salvation and they will diligently carry out other things which are done for the dead.&nbsp; After that they will celebrate my anniversary as they do the anniversary of Abbot Bernard and of other abbots.</span></p><p>Present at the gift of this benefice on my part were:&nbsp; Hugh Candid, Raoul of Brenne, Nivelo, marshal Hildegar, Gamel brother of Gilduin, Andrew Barba, Gilduin of La Madeleine(?), Daniel and Borel, sons, Gobillon, Peter of Rolleiz (Roileicio), Guarin brother of Gradulph, Caveler Curiat.
