<h2> Translated letter:</h2>Commission to Henry de Bathonia and Geoffrey de Langele to make partitions between the heirs of Randolf, sometime earl of Chester, as well of the chief messuage of Rependon as of the services, homages, lands and tenements, which Clemence, countess of Chester, held in dower of the gift of the said earl on the day of her death. They are to meet for this on Monday after the octaves of the Assumption at Rependon, and if they find any of the heirs rebellious and unwilling to abide by their partition, they are not for this to omit making the said partition. The sheriff of Derby is to provide jurors, and for the greater evidence of the making of the partition the king is causing to be sent to them extents of all the said lands made with the assent of the said heirs.
Attested by Queen Eleanor and R. earl of Cornwall. The like is commanded to the sheriff of Dereby with this addition, that William de Ferrariis, earl of Dereby, and each of the other heirs have equally on his behalf in the said messuage one man in the name of seisin.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Historical context:</h2>When Henry III went to Gascony to deal with a rebellion, he appointed Eleanor to run the government with the counsel of his brother Richard of Cornwall (who was married to Eleanorâ€™s sister Sanchia). The Patent Rolls record the actions she took in that position.
<h2 class="mt-4"> Scholarly notes:</h2>(1) After the first two volumes of the Patent Rolls published in Latin, the editors shifted to English translations, explaining that the "language tends gradually to become more formal and verbose."
