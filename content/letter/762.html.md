Juravimus etiam quod nos juvabimus ipsum archiepiscopum contra omnem creaturam que posset vivere et mori, salva fidelitate domini regis et domine regine, et aliorum qui melius sunt domini nostri quam archiepiscopus antedictus, et salva fidelitate hominum nostrorum quos habemus die confectionis presentium litterarum, quandiu de feodis que de nobis tenent, coram nobis voluerint justificare.  Juravimus etiam dicto archiepiscopo quod non faciemus homagium quandiu vixerimus alicui homini, neque recipiemus aliquem hominem nostrum, propter quod dicte conventiones possint deteriorari, vel minus bene teneri, nisi de voluntate et assensu archiepiscopi memorati.  Ego, Theobaldus comes, de istis conventionibus excepi dominam ducissam Burgundie, et dominum ducem filium ejus, et dominum episcopum, Lingonensem.  In cujus testimonium . . . Actum anno gratie MCCXXVII die sabbati proximo post Purificationem Beate Marie.
